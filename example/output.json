    "### Winged Death\n\nI.\n\nThe Orange Hotel is located on High Street near the railway station in Bloemfontein, South Africa. On Sunday, January 24, 1932, four men sat trembling with fear in a room on the third floor. One of them was George C. Titteridge, the hotel owner; another was police constable Ian De Witt from the Central Station; a third was Johannes Bogaert, the local medical examiner; and the fourth, who appeared to be the most composed of the group, was Dr. Cornelius Van Keulen, the medical examiner's physician.\n\nOn the floor, uncomfortably noticeable in the stifling summer heat, lay the lifeless body of a man—but this was not what terrified the four men. Their gazes shifted from the table, which held a peculiar collection of items, to the ceiling above, where a series of large, shaky alphabetical characters had somehow been scribbled in ink; and every now and then, Dr. Van Keulen would sneak a quick glance at a worn leather notebook he held in his left hand. The horror experienced by the four men seemed to be equally directed towards the notebook, the words scrawled on the ceiling, and a dead fly with a peculiar appearance that floated in a bottle of ammonia on the table. Also on the table were an open inkwell, a pen and notepad, a doctor's medical bag, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and a glass about one-fourth full of black oxide of manganese.",
    "The old leather book was the journal of the dead man on the floor, and immediately made it clear that the name \"Frederick N. Mason, Mining Properties, Toronto, Canada\", signed in the hotel register, was a false one. There were other things—terrible things—which it also made clear; and still other things of even greater terror that it hinted at hideously without fully explaining or even being fully believable. It was the half-belief of the four men, nurtured by lives spent close to the dark, secretive mysteries of brooding Africa, that caused them to shiver so violently despite the scorching January heat.\n\nThe blank book was not very big, and the entries were written in a neat handwriting that became more careless and anxious-looking towards the end. It consisted of a series of notes at first irregularly spaced, but eventually becoming daily. To call it a diary would not be entirely accurate, as it only chronicled one aspect of the writer's activities. Dr. Van Keulen immediately recognized the name of the dead man as soon as he opened the cover, as it belonged to a respected member of his own profession who had been heavily involved in African affairs. In the next moment, he was horrified to discover that this name was associated with a heinous crime, officially unsolved, which had dominated the newspapers about four months earlier. And the more he read, the greater his horror, awe, and feelings of disgust and panic intensified.",
    "Here, basically, is the text that the doctor read out loud in that creepy and increasingly foul-smelling room while the three men around him breathed heavily, squirmed in their chairs, and glanced nervously at the ceiling, the table, the thing on the floor, and each other:\n\nJOURNAL OF\n\nTHOMAS SLAUENWITE, M.D.\n\nRegarding punishment of Henry Sargent Moore, Ph.D., of Brooklyn, New York, Professor of Invertebrate Biology in Columbia University, New York, N.Y. Intended to be read after my death, to satisfy the need to make public my revenge, which might not be attributed to me even if it succeeds.\n\nJanuary 5, 1929—I have now fully decided to kill Dr. Henry Moore, and a recent incident has shown me how I will do it. From now on, I will follow a consistent plan of action; hence the start of this journal.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat the circumstances that have driven me to this course, as the informed part of the public is familiar with all the important details. I was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on April 12, 1885, the son of Dr. Paul Slauenwite, formerly of Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. Studying medicine as part of my family tradition, I was led by my father (who died in 1916, while I was serving in France in a South African regiment) to specialize in African fevers; and after graduating from Columbia, I spent a lot of time researching that took me from Durban, in Natal, up to the equator itself.",
    "In Mombasa, I developed my new theory on the transmission and progression of remittent fever. I had some assistance from the papers of the late government physician, Sir Norman Sloane, which I discovered in the house I was living in. When I published my findings, I instantly gained recognition as an esteemed authority. I was informed of the high likelihood of obtaining a prestigious position in the South African health service, and even a potential knighthood, if I were to become a naturalized citizen. Consequently, I took the necessary steps.\n\nHowever, an incident occurred that compelled me to contemplate killing Henry Moore. He was my classmate and a long-time friend both in America and Africa, yet he deliberately sought to undermine my claim to my own theory. He alleged that Sir Norman Sloane had already anticipated my ideas in every significant aspect, insinuating that I had likely discovered more of his papers than I had disclosed in my account. To support this ludicrous accusation, he presented personal letters from Sir Norman that indeed indicated the older man had explored the same ground as me and would have published his results shortly before his untimely demise. I could only acknowledge this with regret. What I could not tolerate was the jealous suspicion that I had stolen the theory from Sir Norman's papers. The British government, sensibly enough, disregarded these baseless allegations but withheld the promised appointment and knighthood, citing that while my theory was original to me, it was not actually new.",
    "I soon realized that my career in Africa was being hindered; even though I had placed all my hopes on such a career, to the extent of giving up my American citizenship. There was a noticeable coolness towards me among the Government group in Mombasa, especially among those who had known Sir Norman. It was at that moment that I decided to settle the score with Moore, sooner or later, although I did not know how. He had been envious of my early fame and had used his previous correspondence with Sir Norman to ruin me. This came from the friend whom I had personally encouraged to take an interest in Africa—who I had guided and motivated until he achieved his current modest fame as an expert on African insects. Even now, I cannot deny that his knowledge is profound. I made him, and in return he has ruined me. But someday, I will destroy him.\n\nWhen I saw myself losing ground in Mombasa, I applied for my current position in the interior—at M'gonga, just fifty miles from the Uganda border. It is a trading post for cotton and ivory, with only eight other white men besides myself. A dreadful place, almost on the equator, infested with every kind of fever known to mankind. Poisonous snakes and insects are everywhere, and the locals suffer from diseases that no one outside of medical school has ever heard of. But my work is not demanding, and I always have plenty of time to plan my revenge against Henry Moore. It amuses me to prominently display his book, \"Diptera of Central and Southern Africa,\" on my shelf. I suppose it is actually a reputable manual—they use it at Columbia, Harvard, and the University of Wisconsin—but my own contributions are truly responsible for half of its strengths.",
    "Last week I came across the thing that made me decide how to deal with Moore. A group from Uganda brought in a black man who had a strange illness that I still can't diagnose. He was very sluggish, had a very low body temperature, and walked in a peculiar manner. Most of the others were afraid of him and believed he was under some kind of witch-doctor's spell; but Gobo, the interpreter, said he had been bitten by an insect. I can't imagine what kind of insect it was, as there is only a small puncture on his arm. However, it is bright red with a purple ring around it, giving it a ghostly appearance. It's no wonder the locals attribute it to black magic. They seem to have seen similar cases before and say there's really nothing that can be done about it.\n\nOld N'Kuru, one of the Galla boys at the post, believes it must be the bite of a devil-fly. According to him, this fly gradually weakens its victim and causes them to die, and then takes hold of their soul and personality if it is still alive itself. It supposedly flies around with all their likes, dislikes, and consciousness. It's a strange legend, and I don't know of any local insect that is deadly enough to explain it. I gave this sick black man, whose name is Mevana, a strong dose of quinine and took a sample of his blood for testing, but I haven't made much progress. There is definitely a peculiar germ present, but I can't even remotely identify it. The closest thing to it is the bacteria one finds in cattle, horses, and dogs that have been bitten by tsetse-flies. However, tsetse-flies don't infect humans, and this region is too far north for them anyway.",
    "However—the important thing is that I've decided how to kill Moore. If this interior region has insects as poisonous as the locals say, I'll make sure he receives a shipment of them from a source he won't suspect, and with plenty of assurances that they are harmless. I trust him to disregard all caution when it comes to studying an unknown species—and then we'll see what happens! It shouldn't be difficult to find an insect that frightens the locals so much. First, let's see how poor Mevana turns out—and then we'll find my envoy of death.\n\nJan. 7—Mevana is no better, even though I have injected all the antidotes I know of. He has fits of trembling, during which he rants fearfully about how his soul will pass into the insect that bit him when he dies, but in between, he remains in a kind of half-conscious state. His heart is still beating strongly, so I might be able to save him. I'll try to, as he can probably guide me better than anyone else to the area where he was bitten.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll write to Dr. Lincoln, my predecessor here, because Allen, the head manager, says he had extensive knowledge of the local diseases. If any white man knows about the death-fly, it would be him. He's currently in Nairobi, and a local runner should be able to get me a response within a week—using the railway for part of the journey.",
    "Jan. 10—Patient remains the same, but I have found what I need! It was in an old book of the local medical records, which I've been studying diligently while waiting for a response from Lincoln. Thirty years ago, there was a widespread disease that killed thousands of natives in Uganda, and it was definitely traced back to a rare fly called _Glossina palpalis_—a type of cousin to the _Glossina marsitans,_ or tsetse fly. It resides in the bushes along the shores of lakes and rivers, and feeds on the blood of crocodiles, antelopes, and large mammals. When these animals are infected with trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, the fly picks up the infection and becomes highly contagious after a period of thirty-one days. For seventy-five days after that, anyone or anything it bites is certain to die.\n\nWithout a doubt, this must be the \"devil-fly\" that the locals talk about. Now I know what I'm dealing with. I hope Mevana recovers. I should hear back from Lincoln in about four or five days—he has a great track record in situations like this. My biggest challenge will be to transport the flies to Moore without him realizing what they are. With his tireless dedication to scholarship, it wouldn't be surprising if he already knows everything about them since they are actually documented.",
    "Jan. 15—Just received an update from Lincoln, who confirms everything that the records say about Glossina palpalis. He has a cure for sleeping-sickness that has been successful in many cases, as long as it's administered early enough. He suggests intermuscular injections of tryparsamide. Since Mevana was bitten about two months ago, I'm not sure how effective it will be—but Lincoln mentioned that cases have lasted up to eighteen months, so maybe it's not too late. Lincoln sent over some of his medication, so I just gave Mevana a strong dose. He's currently in a dazed state. They've brought his main wife from the village, but he doesn't even recognize her. If he recovers, he can definitely show me where the flies are. According to reports, he's an excellent crocodile hunter and knows all of Uganda very well. I'll give him another dose tomorrow.\n\nJan. 16—Mevana seems a bit more alert today, but his heart rate is slowing down. I'll continue with the injections, but not overdo them.\n\nJan. 17—Signs of recovery were evident today. Mevana opened his eyes and showed signs of consciousness, although he seemed confused, after the injection. I hope Moore doesn't know about tryparsamide. There's a good chance he doesn't, since he never had much interest in medicine. Mevana's tongue appeared paralyzed, but I think it will improve once he fully wakes up. I wouldn't mind getting some good sleep myself, but not like this!",
    "Jan. 25—Mevana almost cured! In another week, he can accompany me into the jungle. He was scared when he first arrived—afraid that the fly would take his personality after he died—but he became more hopeful when I assured him that he would recover. His wife, Ugowe, now takes good care of him, so I can rest a little. Then it's time to face the messengers of death!\n\nFeb. 3—Mevana is now healthy, and I have discussed with him the idea of hunting flies. He is reluctant to go near the place where they found him, but I am appealing to his gratitude. Besides, he believes that I can prevent disease as well as cure it. His courage would put a white man to shame—there's no doubt that he will go. I can justify the trip to the head factor by claiming that it is for the sake of local health work.\n\nMarch 12—Finally in Uganda! I have five boys with me, all of them Gallas. The local black people refused to come near this area after hearing what happened to Mevana. This jungle is incredibly unpleasant—filled with noxious vapors. All the lakes appear stagnant. We stumbled upon remnants of ancient ruins in one spot, which even made the Gallas run away in fear. They claim that these massive stones are older than humans and used to be a dwelling or outpost for \"The Fishers from Outside\"—whatever that means—and the malevolent gods Tsadogwa and Clulu. To this day, they are believed to possess a harmful influence and are somehow connected to the devil-flies.",
    "March 15—Arrived at Lake Mlolo this morning—where Mevana got bitten. A horrible, slimy mess, covered in green scum and filled with crocodiles. Mevana has set up a trap made of thin wire netting, baited with crocodile meat. It has a small entrance, and once the prey enters, they don't have the sense to escape. As foolish as they are deadly, and always hungry for fresh meat or a bowl of blood. I hope we can gather a good amount. I've decided that I need to experiment with them—find a way to alter their appearance so that Moore won't recognize them. Perhaps I can crossbreed them with another species, creating a strange hybrid that still carries the infection. We'll see. I need to be patient, but I'm not in a rush now. When I'm ready, I'll have Mevana bring me some infected meat to feed my messengers of death—and then off to the post office. It shouldn't be difficult to obtain the infection, as this area is like a breeding ground for diseases.\n\nMarch 16—Good fortune. Two cages full. Five lively specimens with wings shining like diamonds. Mevana is transferring them into a large container with a tightly meshed lid, and I believe we caught them just in time. We can transport them to M'gonga without any issues. Bringing plenty of crocodile meat for their sustenance. Undoubtedly, all or most of it is contaminated.",
    "April 20—Back at M’gonga and busy in the laboratory. I have sent a request to Dr. Joost in Pretoria for some tsetse-flies to conduct hybridization experiments. If successful, this crossing should result in something that is both hard to identify and equally as deadly as the _palpalis._ If this doesn’t work, I will try other diptera species from the interior. I have also contacted Dr. Vandervelde at Nyangwe for some of the Congo types. I no longer need to send Mevana for more tainted meat, as I have discovered that I can keep cultures of the germ _Trypanosoma gambiense,_ which was obtained from the meat we acquired last month, almost indefinitely in tubes. When the time comes, I will taint some fresh meat and feed it to my winged envoys—then off they go!\n\nJune 18—The tsetse-flies from Joost arrived today. I had already prepared breeding cages long ago, so I am now making selections. I plan to use ultra-violet rays to expedite the life-cycle. Luckily, I have the necessary equipment in my regular setup. Naturally, I am keeping my actions a secret from everyone. The limited knowledge of the few men here makes it easy for me to hide my intentions and pretend that I am merely studying existing species for medical purposes.",
    "June 29—The crossing is productive! Found good amounts of eggs last Wednesday, and now I have some excellent larvae. If the mature insects look as strange as these do, I don't need to do anything else. I am preparing separate numbered cages for the different specimens.\n\nJuly 7—New hybrids have emerged! Their appearance is very similar in shape, but the shine on their wings still suggests _palpalis._ The thorax faintly resembles the stripes of the tsetse. There is some slight variation among individuals. I am feeding them all tainted crocodile meat, and once they become infectious, I will try them on some of the black insects - seemingly by accident, of course. There are so many mildly venomous flies around here that I can easily do it without arousing suspicion. I will release an insect in my securely screened dining-room when Batta, my house-boy, brings in breakfast - while keeping a close watch myself. Once it has completed its task, I will capture or swat it - which should be easy due to its lack of intelligence - or suffocate it by filling the room with chlorine gas. If it doesn't work the first time, I will try again until it does. Of course, I will have the tryparsamide ready in case I get bitten myself - but I will be careful to avoid biting, as there is no truly certain antidote.",
    "Aug. 10—The infectivity has matured and successfully stung Batta. I caught the fly on him and put it back in its cage. I relieved his pain with iodine, and he is very thankful for the help. Tomorrow, I will try a different specimen on Gamba, the messenger for the factor. That will be the last tests I will do here, but if I need more, I will take some specimens to Ukala for additional data.\n\nAug. 11—Failed to get Gamba, but caught the fly alive again. Batta still seems to be fine and doesn't have any pain in the spot where he was stung. I will wait before attempting to get Gamba again.\n\nAug. 14—Finally received a shipment of insects from Vandervelde. There are a total of seven different species, some of which are more or less poisonous. I am keeping them well-fed in case the tsetse crossing doesn't work. Some of these insects look different from the palpalis, but the concern is that they may not be able to reproduce with it.\n\nAug. 17—Managed to get Gamba this afternoon, but had to kill the fly on him. It bit him on the left shoulder. I treated the bite, and Gamba is just as grateful as Batta was. No change in Batta's condition.",
    "Aug. 20—Gamba remains unchanged for now—Batta as well. I am experimenting with a new method of disguise to enhance the hybridization—some kind of dye to alter the noticeable shine of the _palpalis' wings. A bluish color would be ideal—something I can spray on a whole batch of insects. I will begin by examining substances like Prussian and Turnbull's blue—iron and cyanogen salts.\n\nAug. 25—Batta complained of back pain today—things may be progressing.\n\nSept. 3—My experiments have made decent progress. Batta is showing signs of fatigue and constantly complains about his back hurting. Gamba is starting to feel uneasy due to the bite on his shoulder.\n\nSept. 24—Batta's condition is worsening and he is becoming increasingly frightened of his bite. He believes it must be a malicious fly and begged me to kill it—since he witnessed me capturing it—until I convinced him that it had died a while ago. He mentioned that he didn't want his soul to inhabit it after his death. To maintain his morale, I administer plain water shots to him using a hypodermic needle. It is evident that the fly retains all the characteristics of the _palpalis._ Gamba is also feeling unwell and experiencing the same symptoms as Batta. I may consider giving him a chance with tryparsamide, since the effects of the fly have been sufficiently proven. However, I will let Batta continue, as I want to have a rough estimate of how long it takes to resolve a case.",
    "Dye experiments progressing well. A different form of iron hexacyanoferrate, with some mixture of potassium salts, can be dissolved in alcohol and sprayed on the insects with great success. It colors the wings blue without greatly affecting the dark thorax, and does not wash off when I sprinkle the specimens with water. With this disguise, I believe I can use the current tsetse hybrids and avoid the need for further experiments. Even with his sharpness, Moore would not be able to recognize a blue-winged fly with a partially tsetse thorax. Naturally, I keep all these dye activities strictly confidential. There must never be any connection between me and the blue flies in the future.\n\nOct. 9—Batta is lethargic and has taken to his bed. I have been administering tryparsamide to Gamba for two weeks, and I believe he will recover.\n\nOct. 25—Batta is very ill, but Gamba is nearly well.\n\nNov. 18—Batta died yesterday, and something peculiar occurred that sent a chill down my spine considering the local legends and Batta's own fears. When I returned to the laboratory after his death, I heard an unusual buzzing and thrashing in cage 12, which contained the fly that had bitten Batta. The creature appeared frantic but became still when I approached—landing on the wire netting and staring at me in a strange manner. It extended its legs through the wires as if it were confused. When I returned from dining with Allen, the creature was dead. Evidently, it had gone mad and beaten itself to death against the sides of the cage.",
    "It's really strange that this is happening just after Batta died. If anyone black had seen it, they would have immediately attributed it to the absorption of the poor devil's soul. I will send my blue-stained hybrid flies on their way soon. The hybrid flies seem to be killing at a slightly higher rate than the pure \"palpalis\" flies, if anything. Batta died three months and eight days after being infected, but of course there is always a large margin of uncertainty. I almost wish I had let Gamba's case continue.\n\nDecember 5th - Busy figuring out how to send my envoys to Moore. They need to appear as if they come from an unbiased entomologist who has read his book on flies in Central and Southern Africa and is interested in studying this \"new and unidentifiable species\". There must also be enough assurances that the blue-winged fly is harmless, as proven by the natives' extensive experience. Moore will be caught off guard, and one of the flies will surely get him at some point, although it's impossible to say exactly when.\n\nI'll have to rely on letters from my friends in New York—who still mention Moore from time to time—to keep me updated on the early results, although I'm sure the newspapers will announce his death. Above all, I must not show any interest in his case. I will mail the flies while on a trip, but I must not be recognized when I do it. The best plan is to take a long vacation in a remote area, grow a beard, mail the package at Ukala while pretending to be a visiting entomologist, and then return here after shaving off the beard.",
    "April 12, 1930—I'm back in M'gonga after my long trip. Everything went smoothly and as planned. I sent the flies to Moore without leaving any evidence behind. I had a Christmas vacation on December 15th and immediately set off with the necessary supplies. I made a well-constructed container that had enough space to include some germ-infected crocodile meat as food for the messengers. By the end of February, my beard had grown long enough to shape into a neat Vandyke style.\n\nI arrived at Ukala on March 9th and used the typewriter at the trading post to write a letter to Moore. I signed it as \"Nevil Wayland-Hall,\" pretending to be a London-based insect expert. I think I struck the right tone, showing interest as a fellow scientist. I made sure to casually emphasize the \"complete harmlessness\" of the specimens. No one suspected a thing. As soon as I reached the bush, I shaved off my beard to avoid any noticeable tan lines when I returned. I didn't need native bearers except for a small section of swamp—I can manage with just one backpack, and I have a good sense of direction. It's fortunate that I'm accustomed to such travel. To explain my prolonged absence, I mentioned a bout of fever and some navigational errors while passing through the bush.",
    "But now comes the most difficult part mentally—waiting for news of Moore without showing the strain. Of course, he may possibly avoid being bitten until the venom runs out—but knowing how reckless he is, the chances are heavily against him. I have no regrets; after what he did to me, he deserves this and more.\n\nJune 30, 1930—Hooray! The first step worked! Just heard casually from Dyson of Columbia that Moore had received some new blue-winged flies from Africa, and he is greatly puzzled by them! No mention of any bite—but if I know Moore’s careless ways as well as I think I do, there will be one soon!\n\nAugust 27, 1930—Letter from Morton in Cambridge. He says Moore writes of feeling very tired, and mentions an insect bite on the back of his neck—from a strange new specimen he received around the middle of June. Have I succeeded? Apparently Moore doesn’t connect the bite with his weakness. If this is the real deal, then Moore was bitten well within the insect’s infectious period.\n\nSept. 12, 1930—Victory! Another message from Dyson says that Moore is truly in a concerning condition. He now links his illness to the bite he received around noon on June 19, and is quite confused about the identity of the insect. He is attempting to contact the “Nevil Wayland-Hall” who sent him the shipment. Out of the hundred or so that I sent, around twenty-five seem to have reached him alive. Some escaped at the time of the bite, but several larvae have appeared from eggs laid since they were mailed. Dyson says he is carefully incubating these larvae. Once they mature, I suppose he’ll identify the tsetse-palpalis hybridization—but that won’t help him much now. He'll probably wonder why the blue wings aren't inherited!",
    "Nov. 8, 1930—Letters from six friends inform me about Moore's severe illness. Dyson's letter arrived today. He states that Moore is completely confused about the hybrids that emerged from the larvae and is starting to suspect that the parents acquired their blue wings through some artificial means. Moore is now confined to bed most of the time. There is no mention of him using tryparsamide.\n\nFeb. 13, 1931—Not looking good! Moore's condition is deteriorating, and he seems to have no solution. However, I believe he suspects me. Last month, Morton sent me a very cold letter that didn't reveal anything about Moore. Now, Dyson also writes in a rather restrained manner, mentioning that Moore is developing theories about the whole situation. He has been searching for \"Wayland-Hall\" via telegraph in London, Ukala, Nairobi, Mombasa, and other places, but of course, he finds nothing. I assume he has told Dyson who he suspects, but Dyson doesn't believe it yet. I fear Morton does believe it.\n\nIt appears that I should make plans to leave this place and completely erase my identity. What a tragic end to a once-promising career! More of Moore's work, but this time he is paying the price in advance. I think I will return to South Africa and, in the meantime, discreetly deposit funds there under the name of my new self— \"Frederick Nasmyth Mason from Toronto, Canada, a broker specializing in mining properties.\" I will establish a new signature for identification. If I never have to take this step, I can easily transfer the funds back to my current self.",
    "August 15, 1931—Half a year has passed, and the suspense is still ongoing. Dyson, Morton, and other friends have stopped writing to me. Dr. James from San Francisco occasionally hears from Moore's friends and says that Moore is in a constant coma. He hasn't been able to walk since May. While he was able to talk, he complained about feeling cold. Now he can't speak, although it is believed that he still has moments of consciousness. His breathing is short and rapid, and can be heard from a distance. There is no doubt that Trypanosoma gambiense is feasting on him, but he is holding up better than the locals around here. Batta finished three months and eight days ago, and yet Moore is still alive over a year after being bitten. Last month, I heard rumors of an intensive search for \"Wayland-Hall\" around Ukala. However, I don't think I need to worry yet, as there is absolutely nothing that connects me to this matter.\n\nOctober 7, 1931—It's finally over! I read the news in the Mombasa Gazette. Moore died on September 20 after experiencing trembling fits and having a significantly low body temperature. That's the end of that! I said I would get him, and I did! The newspaper had a lengthy report about his long illness and death, as well as the unsuccessful search for \"Wayland-Hall\". It's clear that Moore was a more important figure in Africa than I had realized. The insect that bit him has now been fully identified from the remaining specimens and developed larvae, and the staining on their wings has also been discovered. It is widely understood that these flies were intentionally prepared and sent to kill. Apparently, Moore shared certain suspicions with Dyson, but both he and the police are keeping it a secret due to lack of evidence. All of Moore's enemies are being investigated, and the Associated Press suggests that there may be an inquiry involving a prominent physician who is currently overseas.",
    "One thing right at the end of the report—no doubt, the sensationalizing of a tabloid journalist—gives me a strange shudder when I think about the stories of the African people and the way the fly acted strangely when Batta died. Apparently, something unusual happened on the night of Moore’s death; Dyson was woken up by the buzzing of a blue-winged fly—which then flew out of the window—just before the nurse called to give the news of Moore’s death from his home in Brooklyn, miles away.\n\nBut what worries me the most is the African aspect of this matter. The people in Ukala remember the bearded stranger who wrote the letter and sent the package, and the police are searching the entire area for any black people who may have helped him. I didn't use many of them, but if the officers question the Ubandes who guided me through the N’Kini jungle belt, I will have more explaining to do than I would like. It seems like the time has come for me to disappear; so tomorrow I think I'll quit my job and get ready to go to unknown places.\n\nNovember 9, 1931—It was difficult to get my resignation approved, but today I finally got the release. I didn't want to arouse suspicion by leaving suddenly. Last week I heard about Moore’s death from James—but nothing more than what's in the newspapers. The people around him in New York seem reluctant to share the details, although they all mention an extensive investigation. I haven't received any word from my friends in the East. Moore must have spread some dangerous suspicions before he lost consciousness—but there is no evidence he could have presented.",
    "Still, I am not taking any risks. On Thursday, I will begin my journey to Mombasa, and from there, I will take a ship down the coast to Durban. After that, I will disappear from sight. However, soon after, Frederick Nasmyth Mason, a broker for mining properties from Toronto, will show up in Johannesburg.\n\nLet this be the conclusion of my journal. If, in the end, I am not suspected, it will fulfill its original purpose after my death and reveal information that would otherwise remain unknown. If, on the other hand, these suspicions do arise and persist, it will confirm and clarify the vague accusations, filling in many important and perplexing gaps. Of course, if danger comes my way, I will have to destroy it.\n\nWell, Moore is dead—as he deserves to be. Now Dr. Thomas Slauenwite is also dead. And when the body previously belonging to Thomas Slauenwite is dead, the public may have access to this record.\n\nII.\n\nJanuary 15, 1932—A new year and a reluctant resumption of this journal. This time, I am writing solely to ease my mind, as it would be foolish to believe that the case is not definitively closed. I am now settled in the Vaal Hotel, Johannesburg, using my new name, and so far, no one has questioned my true identity. I have engaged in some inconclusive business discussions to maintain the facade of a mine broker and believe that I may actually establish myself in that field. Later, I will travel to Toronto and leave some evidence to support my fictional past.",
    "But what is bothering me is a bug that invaded my room around noon today. Of course, I have been having all sorts of bad dreams about blue flies lately, but those were expected given my current state of nerves. However, this thing was a real, living insect, and I have no idea how it got in. It buzzed around my bookshelf for a good fifteen minutes, and I couldn't catch or kill it no matter what I tried. The strangest thing about it was its color and appearance - it had blue wings and looked exactly like my hybrid messengers of death. I have no idea how it could possibly be one of them. I got rid of all the hybrids - stained and unstained - that I didn't send to Moore, and I can't remember any of them escaping.\n\nCould this be just a hallucination? Or is it possible that some of the specimens that got loose in Brooklyn when Moore was bitten found their way back to Africa? There was that ridiculous tale about the blue fly that woke Dyson when Moore died - but when you think about it, the survival and return of some of these creatures is not out of the question. It's also plausible that the blue pigment I used on their wings would stay, almost like a tattoo. By process of elimination, that seems to be the only logical explanation for this bug. Although, it is quite strange that it managed to come so far south. Maybe it's some kind of inherited homing instinct from the tsetse strain. After all, that aspect of it comes from South Africa.",
    "I need to be cautious about getting bitten. Of course, the original poison—if this is actually one of the flies that got away from Moore—was used up a long time ago; but the guy must have eaten as he flew back from America, and he might have gone through Central Africa and picked up a fresh infection. Actually, that's more likely than not; because the part of his heritage from the _palpalis_ would naturally lead him back to Uganda, and all the germs of trypanosomiasis. I still have some of the tryparsamide left—I couldn't bring myself to get rid of my medicine case, even though it might incriminate me—but since I read about it, I'm not as sure about the drug's effectiveness as I used to be. It gives you a fighting chance—definitely saved Gamba—but there's always a high chance of failure.\n\nIt's really strange that this fly happened to come into my room—out of all places in Africa! It seems almost too coincidental. I guess if it comes back, I'll definitely kill it. I'm surprised I didn't catch it today, because usually these guys are really dumb and easy to catch. Could it all be just an illusion? The heat has been getting to me lately like never before—even up in Uganda.",
    "January 16—Am I going crazy? The fly returned again today and behaved so strangely that I can't make sense of it. Only my imagination could explain what that annoying insect seemed to do. It appeared out of nowhere and went straight to my bookshelf, repeatedly circling around a copy of Moore's _Diptera of Central and Southern Africa_. Every now and then, it would land on the top or back of the book, and sometimes it would quickly fly towards me and retreat before I could swat it with a folded paper. Such cleverness is unheard of among the famously unintelligent African flies. I spent almost thirty minutes trying to catch the cursed thing, but in the end, it darted out of the window through a hole in the screen that I hadn't noticed. At times, I felt like it was purposely taunting me by coming within reach of my weapon and then skillfully evading me. I need to hold onto my sanity tightly.\n\nJanuary 17—Either I am insane, or the world is experiencing some sudden suspension of the laws of probability as we understand them. That cursed fly came in from somewhere just before noon and started buzzing around the copy of Moore's _Diptera_ on my bookshelf. Once again, I tried to catch it, and once again, yesterday's experience repeated itself. Finally, the pest headed towards the open inkwell on my table and dipped itself in - only the legs and thorax, keeping its wings clear. Then it flew up to the ceiling and landed, moving in a curved path and leaving a trail of ink behind. After a while, it hopped a little and created a single ink spot that wasn't connected to the trail. Then, it dropped right in front of my face and buzzed away before I could grab it.",
    "Something about this whole situation seemed incredibly sinister and abnormal to me—more so than I could explain to myself. When I examined the ink trail on the ceiling from different angles, it appeared more and more familiar, and it suddenly dawned on me that it formed a perfectly shaped question mark. What could be a more fitting symbol of malevolence? I'm amazed I didn't faint. Thankfully, the hotel staff hasn't noticed it yet. I haven't seen the fly this afternoon and evening, but I'm keeping my inkwell tightly closed. I believe my extermination of Moore must be weighing on me, causing these morbid hallucinations. Perhaps there isn't a fly at all.\n\nJan. 18—What kind of strange living nightmare have I been thrust into? What happened today is something that shouldn't normally occur—and yet, a hotel staff member has witnessed the marks on the ceiling and acknowledges their reality. Around eleven o'clock this morning, while I was writing on a manuscript, something quickly descended to the inkwell and flew back up before I could catch sight of it. When I looked up, I saw that accursed fly on the ceiling, crawling along and leaving another trail of curves and turns. I was helpless, so I prepared a newspaper to catch the creature if it came close enough. After making several turns on the ceiling, it flew into a dark corner and vanished. As I gazed at the now doubly defaced plastering above, I realized that the new ink trail formed a huge and unmistakable figure 5!",
    "For a while, I was almost unconscious from a wave of unnamed threat that I couldn't fully understand. Then I gathered my courage and took action. I went to a pharmacy and bought some gum and other items needed to make a sticky trap, along with a duplicate inkwell. When I returned to my room, I filled the new inkwell with the sticky mixture and placed it where the old one had been, leaving it open. Then I tried to focus on my reading. Around three o'clock, I heard the cursed insect again and saw it flying around the new inkwell. It landed on the sticky surface but didn't touch it, and then flew straight towards me, retreating before I could strike it. After that, it went to the bookshelf and circled around Moore's book. There is something profound and devilish about the way the intruder lingers near that book.\n\nThe worst part came last. Leaving Moore's book, the insect flew over to the open window and started rhythmically beating itself against the wire screen. It would make a series of beats, followed by another series of equal length, and then a pause, repeating this pattern. Something about this performance kept me frozen for a few moments, but then I went to the window and tried to kill the irritating creature. As usual, it was futile. It simply flew across the room to a lamp and continued beating the same pattern on the stiff cardboard shade. I felt a vague sense of despair and proceeded to close all the doors, as well as the window with the imperceptible hole in the screen. It felt absolutely necessary to eliminate this persistent being, whose relentless pursuit was quickly driving me insane. Then, without realizing it, I began to notice that each series of beats consisted of exactly _five_ strokes.",
    "Five—the same number that the thing had marked in ink on the ceiling in the morning! Could there be any possible connection? The idea was insane, as it would imply a human intellect and knowledge of written numbers in the strange fly. A human intellect—did that bring to mind the ancient legends of the Uganda blacks? And yet, there was a diabolical cleverness in evading me, unlike the usual stupidity of the breed. As I put away my folded paper and sat down with growing horror, the insect buzzed up and disappeared through a hole in the ceiling where the radiator pipe led to the room above.\n\nThe departure did not comfort me, as my mind began to wander into wild and terrifying thoughts. If this fly possessed human intelligence, where did that intelligence come from? Was there any truth to the native belief that these creatures take on the personality of their victims after their death? If so, whose personality did this fly carry? I had deduced that it must be one of those that escaped from Moore when he was bitten. _Was this the harbinger of death that had bitten Moore? If so, what did it want with me?_ What did it want with me anyway? With a cold sweat, I recalled the actions of the fly that bit Batta when he died. Had its own personality been replaced by that of its deceased victim? Then there was that sensational news report of the fly that woke Dyson when Moore died. And as for the fly that was relentlessly pursuing me—could it be driven by a vengeful human personality? How it lingered near Moore's book!—I refused to delve any further into that thought. Suddenly, I became convinced that the creature was indeed infected, and in the most virulent way. With a malicious purpose evident in every action, it must have intentionally charged itself with the deadliest bacteria in all of Africa. My mind, thoroughly shaken, now assumed the human qualities of the creature as a given.",
    "I called the clerk on the telephone and asked for someone to block up the hole in the radiator pipe and any other possible openings in my room. I complained about being bothered by flies, and he seemed to understand and sympathize. When the worker arrived, I showed him the ink stains on the ceiling, which he easily recognized. So they are real! The marks, resembling a question mark and the number 5, intrigued and puzzled him. In the end, he sealed all the holes he could find and repaired the window screen, allowing me to keep both windows open. He clearly thought I was a bit strange, especially since there were no insects in sight while he was there. But I don't care about that anymore. So far, the fly has not appeared this evening. I have no idea what it is, what it wants, or what will happen to me!\n\nJan. 19 - I am completely consumed by horror. The creature has touched me. Something monstrous and demonic is happening around me, and I am a helpless victim. In the morning, when I returned from breakfast, that winged demon from hell entered the room above me and began banging itself against the window screen, just like it did yesterday. However, this time, each series of beats consisted of only four strokes. I hurried to the window and tried to catch it, but as usual, it escaped and flew over to Moore's book, where it buzzed around mockingly. Its ability to make sounds is limited, but I noticed that its buzzing came in groups of four.",
    "By this time I was definitely insane, for I shouted at it, \"Moore, Moore, for the love of God, what do you want?\" When I did so, the creature suddenly stopped circling, flew towards me, and made a low, graceful dip in the air, somehow resembling a bow. Then it flew back to the book. At least, it appeared to do all this—although I no longer trust my senses.\n\nAnd then the worst thing happened. I had left my door open, hoping the monster would leave if I couldn't catch it; but around 11:30 I closed the door, thinking it had gone. Then I settled down to read. Just at noon I felt a tickling sensation on the back of my neck, but when I reached up, there was nothing there. In an instant, I felt the tickling again—and before I could react, that nameless offspring of evil appeared from behind, did another one of those mocking, graceful dips in the air, and flew out through the keyhole—which I had never imagined was big enough to allow its passage.\n\nI had no doubt that the thing had touched me. It had touched me without harming me—and then I suddenly remembered, in a chilling fright, that Moore had been bitten on the back of his neck at noon. There hadn't been any invasion since then—but I have plugged all the keyholes with paper and will keep a folded paper ready for use whenever I open the door to leave or enter.",
    "Jan. 20—I still find it hard to fully believe in the supernatural, but I can't deny that I am filled with fear. This situation is overwhelming for me. Just before noon today, that devilish creature appeared outside the window again and repeated its banging sounds, but this time it did it three times in a row. When I approached the window, it quickly flew away and disappeared from sight. I still have enough determination to take one more defensive action. I removed both window screens and applied my sticky solution, the same one I used in the inkwell, on both sides before putting them back in place. If that creature tries to make another noise, it will meet its demise!\n\nThe rest of the day passed peacefully. Can I endure this ordeal without losing my sanity?\n\nJan. 21—Currently on a train heading towards Bloemfontein.\n\nI am defeated. The creature is winning. It possesses a sinister intelligence that renders all my strategies useless. It appeared outside the window this morning, but it didn't touch the sticky screen. Instead, it veered away without landing and started buzzing around in circles, two at a time, with a brief pause in the air. After several repetitions of this performance, it flew away over the rooftops and vanished from sight. My nerves are on the verge of breaking, as these hints of numbers can be interpreted in a horrifying way. On Monday, the creature focused on the number five; on Tuesday, it was four; on Wednesday, it was three; and now today, it is two. Five, four, three, two—what could this mean other than some monstrous and unimaginable countdown of days? Only the malevolent forces of the universe can comprehend its purpose. I spent the entire afternoon packing and making arrangements for my trunks, and now I have boarded the night express to Bloemfontein. Escaping may prove futile, but what other choice do I have?",
    "Jan. 22—I settled at the Orange Hotel in Bloemfontein, a comfortable and excellent place, but the terror followed me. I had closed all the doors and windows, blocked all the keyholes, searched for any possible cracks, and pulled down all the shades—but just before noon, I heard a dull tap on one of the window-screens. I waited, and after a long pause, another tap came. A second pause, and then another single tap. Raising the shade, I saw that cursed fly, as I had expected. It flew in one large, slow circle in the air and then disappeared from sight. I was left feeling weak and exhausted, and had to rest on the couch. _One!_ This clearly carried the message from the monster. _One_ tap, _one_ circle. Did this mean I had _one_ more day before an unimaginable fate befell me? Should I flee again, or should I fortify myself here by sealing up the room?\n\nAfter an hour's rest, I felt ready to take action and ordered a large reserve supply of canned and packaged food, as well as linen and towels, to be delivered. Tomorrow, I will not, under any circumstances, open any crack in the door or window. When the food and linen arrived, the attendant looked at me strangely, but I no longer care how peculiar or insane I may seem. I am pursued by forces worse than the mockery of mankind. Now that I have received my supplies, I examined every tiny opening in the walls and sealed up every minuscule gap I could find. Finally, I feel capable of getting some real sleep.",
    "Jan. 23—It's almost noon, and I have this strong feeling that something really terrible is about to happen. I didn't sleep as much as I thought I would, even though I barely got any sleep on the train last night. I woke up early, but I've been having trouble focusing on anything—reading or writing. This slow and deliberate counting of days is really getting to me. I don't know which is going crazy—Nature or my mind. Until around eleven, I didn't do much except pace back and forth in the room.\n\nThen I heard a rustling sound among the food packages that were brought in yesterday, and that devilish fly crawled out right in front of me. I quickly grabbed something flat and tried to swat it away, even though I was terrified, but it had the same effect as always. As I moved closer, that terrifying fly flew back to the table where I had stacked my books, and landed for a brief moment on Moore's book about flies in Africa. Then, as I followed it, it flew over to the mantel clock and landed on the face near the number 12. Before I could think of my next move, it started crawling slowly and purposefully around the clock's face—in the direction of the clock hands. It went under the minute hand, curved down and up, went under the hour hand, and finally stopped exactly at the number 12. As it hovered there, it flapped its wings with a buzzing sound.",
    "Is this some sort of omen? I'm becoming as superstitious as the black people. The time is now a little after eleven. Will twelve bring the end? I have only one last option, which I've thought of out of sheer desperation. Remembering that my medical case contains the necessary substances to create chlorine gas, I have decided to fill the room with that deadly vapor, suffocating the fly while protecting myself with a handkerchief soaked in ammonia and tied over my face. Luckily, I have a good supply of ammonia. This makeshift mask should hopefully neutralize the harsh chlorine fumes until the insect is dead, or at least weak enough to crush. But I must act quickly. How can I ensure that the creature won't suddenly dart towards me before I finish my preparations? I shouldn't be wasting time writing in this journal.\n\nLater—Both chemicals, hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide, are on the table ready to be mixed. I've tied the handkerchief over my nose and mouth, and have a bottle of ammonia ready to keep it damp until the chlorine dissipates. I've closed both windows tightly. But I don't like the behavior of that strange creature. It remains on the clock, but slowly crawls backwards from the 12 position to meet the advancing minute hand.",
    "Is this going to be my last entry in this journal? It would be pointless to try and deny what I suspect. Too often, there is a small but unbelievable truth behind the most wild and incredible legends. Is the spirit of Henry Moore trying to reach me through this strange blue-winged creature? Is this the fly that bit him and, as a result, absorbed his consciousness when he died? If that's the case, and if it bites me, will my own identity take over Moore's and enter that buzzing body when I eventually die from the bite? However, maybe I won't have to die even if it gets me. There is always a chance with tryparsamide. And I have no regrets. Moore had to die, regardless of the consequences.\n\nA little later.\n\nThe fly has landed on the clock face near the 45-minute mark. It is currently 11:30. I am saturating the handkerchief on my face with ammonia and keeping the bottle nearby for further use. This will be my final entry before I mix the acid and manganese and release the chlorine. I shouldn't be wasting time, but it helps me to write things down on paper. Without this record, I would have lost my sanity a long time ago. The fly seems to be becoming restless, and the minute hand is approaching it. Now, it's time for the chlorine...",
    "On Sunday, January 24, 1932, after repeatedly knocking without receiving any response from the strange man in Room 303 of the Orange Hotel, a dark-skinned attendant entered with a pass key and immediately ran downstairs screaming to inform the clerk of what he had discovered. The clerk, after informing the police, called for the manager; and together they went to the fatal room accompanied by Constable De Witt, Coroner Bogaert, and Dr. Van Keulen.\n\nThe person occupying the room was lying dead on the floor—his face turned upward, and his mouth covered with a cloth that emitted a strong smell of ammonia. Underneath this covering, the features displayed a look of sheer, absolute terror that was felt by all who saw it. On the back of the neck, Dr. Van Keulen discovered a vicious insect bite—dark red, with a purple ring surrounding it—which suggested the bite of a tsetse fly or something similarly harmful. An examination indicated that death was likely caused by a heart failure brought on by extreme fear rather than the bite itself—although a subsequent autopsy revealed the presence of the trypanosomiasis germ in the body.",
    "On the table were several items—an old leather notebook containing the journal just described, a pen, notepad, and open inkwell, a doctor's medical case with the initials \"T. S.\" marked in gold, bottles of ammonia and hydrochloric acid, and a glass about a quarter full of black manganese dioxide. The ammonia bottle caught a second glance because something other than the liquid seemed to be inside it. Taking a closer look, Coroner Bogaert noticed that the foreign inhabitant was a fly.\n\nIt appeared to be some kind of crossbreed with vague tsetse fly characteristics, but its wings—showing a faint blue color despite the strong ammonia—were a complete mystery. There was something about it that triggered a faint memory of Dr. Van Keulen reading about it in the newspaper—a memory that the journal was soon to confirm. Its lower body parts appeared to have been stained with ink, so deeply that not even the ammonia had bleached them. Perhaps it had fallen into the inkwell at some point, although its wings remained untouched. But how had it managed to fall into the narrow-necked ammonia bottle? It was as if the creature had intentionally crawled inside and ended its own life!",
    "But the most peculiar thing of all was what Constable De Witt noticed on the smooth white ceiling above as he looked around with curiosity. The other three followed his gaze, including Dr. Van Keulen, who had been flipping through the old leather book with a mix of horror, fascination, and disbelief. The object on the ceiling consisted of shaky, uneven ink lines, as if they had been created by a creature soaked in ink crawling along. Immediately, everyone thought of the stains on the fly that was discovered in the ammonia bottle.\n\nHowever, these were not just any ordinary ink lines. Even a quick look revealed something eerily familiar about them, and upon closer examination, all four observers let out gasps of surprise and wonder. Coroner Bogaert instinctively scanned the room to see if there was any possible tool or arrangement of furniture that could explain how these uneven marks were made by a person. Finding nothing of the sort, he continued to gaze upward, filled with curiosity and a sense of awe."
