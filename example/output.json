    "### Winged Death\n\nI.\n\nThe Orange Hotel stands on High Street, close to the railway station in Bloemfontein, South Africa. On Sunday, January 24, 1932, four men sat trembling with fear in a room on the third floor. One of them was George C. Titteridge, the hotel owner; another was police constable Ian De Witt from the Central Station; a third was Johannes Bogaert, the local coroner; and the fourth, who seemed the least disturbed of the group, was Dr. Cornelius Van Keulen, the coroner's physician.\n\nOn the floor, in the sweltering summer heat, lay the body of a dead man. However, this was not the source of the four men's fear. Their gazes shifted from the table, where a strange collection of objects lay, to the ceiling above. On the smooth white surface, a series of large, trembling letters had somehow been scrawled in ink. Every now and then, Dr. Van Keulen would sneak a glance at a worn leather notebook held in his left hand. The horror felt by the four men seemed to be equally directed towards the notebook, the scribbled words on the ceiling, and a peculiar-looking dead fly floating in a bottle of ammonia on the table. Also present on the table were an open inkwell, a pen and notepad, a medical case belonging to a physician, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and a tumbler containing about a quarter of black oxide of manganese."
