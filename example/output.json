    "### Winged Death\n\nI.\n\nThe Orange Hotel stands on High Street near the train station in Bloemfontein, South Africa. On Sunday, January 24, 1932, four men sat trembling with terror in a room on the third floor. One was George C. Titteridge, the hotel owner; another was police constable Ian De Witt from the Central Station; a third was Johannes Bogaert, the local medical examiner; and the fourth, who seemed to be the least disturbed among them, was Dr. Cornelius Van Keulen, the examiner's physician.\n\nOn the floor, uncomfortably noticeable in the suffocating summer heat, was the body of a deceased man—but that was not what terrified the four men. Their eyes shifted from the table, where a strange collection of items lay, to the ceiling above, on which a series of large, shaky letters had somehow been scribbled in ink; and every now and then, Dr. Van Keulen would sneak a glance at a worn leather journal he held in his left hand. The horror experienced by the four men was almost evenly divided between the journal, the scribbled words on the ceiling, and a peculiar-looking dead fly that floated in a bottle of ammonia on the table. Also on the table were an open inkwell, a pen and notepad, a doctor's medical bag, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and a glass that was about a quarter full of black manganese dioxide.",
    "The old leather book was the journal of the deceased man on the floor, and immediately revealed that the name \"Frederick N. Mason, Mining Properties, Toronto, Canada\", signed in the hotel register, was a false identity. It also revealed other horrifying things, and alluded to even more terrifying things that were not fully explained or believed. The four men, who had spent their lives near the dark, secretive secrets of Africa, were filled with a chilling unease despite the intense heat of January.\n\nThe blank book was not very large, and the entries were written in a neat handwriting that became more careless and anxious towards the end. It was not quite a diary, as it only documented one aspect of the writer's activities. Dr. Van Keulen immediately recognized the name of the deceased man when he opened the cover, as he was a well-known member of his own profession who had been involved in African affairs. In another moment, he was horrified to discover that this name was connected to a heinous crime that had remained unsolved and had made headlines in the newspapers about four months earlier. As he read further, his horror, awe, loathing, and panic deepened.",
    "Here, basically, is the text that the doctor read out loud in that creepy and increasingly disgusting room while the three men around him breathed heavily, squirmed in their chairs, and glanced nervously at the ceiling, the table, the thing on the floor, and each other:\n\nJOURNAL OF\n\nTHOMAS SLAUENWITE, M.D.\n\nRegarding punishment of Henry Sargent Moore, Ph.D., of Brooklyn, New York, Professor of Invertebrate Biology at Columbia University, New York, N.Y. Prepared to be read after my death, to satisfy the need to make public my revenge, which might otherwise never be attributed to me even if it succeeds.\n\nJanuary 5, 1929—I have now fully decided to kill Dr. Henry Moore, and a recent incident has shown me how I will do it. From now on, I will follow a consistent course of action; hence the start of this journal.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat the circumstances that have driven me to this path, as the well-informed part of the public is familiar with all the significant facts. I was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on April 12, 1885, the son of Dr. Paul Slauenwite, formerly of Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. Pursuing medicine as part of my family tradition, my father (who died in 1916, while I was serving in France in a South African regiment) led me to specialize in African fevers; and after graduating from Columbia, I spent a lot of time researching that took me from Durban, in Natal, up to the equator itself."
