### gpt-translator

This can translate large (and small) text files using the OpenAI API.

Examle usage:

* Convert complex text to simple text.
* Translate text between different languages.

How It Works:

The text is divided into sections, separated by two or more newlines.
A paragraph is a collection of sections, with a default size limit of max 1024 tokens.

Set a custom token limit for paragraphs with `--max-tokens-paragraph`.
Adjust the wait time after errors using `--failure-sleep`. The wait time doubles with each consecutive error, starting from 10 seconds.

Output is saved to `output` dir, which is created if it does not exist. This can be changed setting the `--working-dir`. Default output translation file is `output/output.md`.

### Usage

You need to have an openai API key. 

Add your openai API key to your environment, e.g. in .bashrc 

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Or add the openai API key to a `.env` file in the directory where you execute `gpt-translator`

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
