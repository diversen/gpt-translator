### gpt-translator

A simple tool for translating text using the openai API.

Give a text file and a prompt the tool will translate the text file using a given prompt.

You can translate a complicated text to a simple text. Or you can translate a text to a different language. Or in short: Translate a text to another text.

Each text is split into sections defined as text separated by at least two newlines. A paragraph is defined as a number of sections with a maximum number of tokens. The default is 1024 tokens. You can change this by using the `--max-tokens-paragraph` option.

The tool keeps track of what paragraphs have been translated and will continue from the last translated paragraph if the tool is stopped or interrupted.

If there is an error the tool will back off exponentially. The default is to sleep 10 second on the first error, 20 seconds on the second error, 40 seconds on the third error, and so on. You can change this by using the `--failure-sleep` option.

### Usage

You need to have an openai API key.

Add this to a `.env` file in your environment:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Or just add it to your environment.
