    "Scene I. A platform in front of a castle.\n\nEnter Francisco and Barnardo, two guards.\n\nBARNARDO.\nWho's there?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nNo, tell me. Stop and reveal yourself.\n\nBARNARDO.\nLong live the King!\n\nFRANCISCO.\nBarnardo?\n\nBARNARDO.\nYes, it's me.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nYou're right on time.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIt's twelve o'clock. Go to bed, Francisco.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nThanks for taking over. It's freezing cold,\nAnd I feel sick.\n\nBARNARDO.\nDid you have a peaceful watch?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nNot a sound, not even a mouse.\n\nBARNARDO.\nWell, good night.\nIf you see Horatio and Marcellus,\nThe other guards, tell them to hurry.\n\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nI think I hear them. Stop, who's there?\n\nHORATIO.\nWe're friends of this place.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nAnd loyal to the King.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nGood night to you.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nFarewell, honest soldier, who relieved you?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nBarnardo took my place. Good night.\n\n[Exit]\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHey, Barnardo!\n\nBARNARDO.\nTell me, is Horatio here?\n\nHORATIO.\nA part of him.\n\nBARNARDO.\nWelcome, Horatio. Welcome, Marcellus.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHas that thing appeared again tonight?\n\nBARNARDO.\nI haven't seen anything.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHoratio thinks it's just our imagination,\nAnd won't believe what we've seen twice.\nSo I asked him to join us tonight\nTo watch and see if it comes again,\nSo he can confirm it with his own eyes.\n\nHORATIO.\nNah, it won't show up.\n\nBARNARDO.\nSit down for a moment,\nAnd let us tell you again,\nEven though you don't believe our story,\nWhat we've seen for the past two nights.\n\nHORATIO.\nFine, let's sit down,\nAnd listen to Barnardo talk about this.\n\nBARNARDO.\nLast night,\nWhen that same star in the west,\nLit up that part of the sky\nWhere it is now shining, Marcellus and I,\nWhen the clock struck oneâ€”",
    "MARCELLUS:\nCalm down. Look, it's coming back.\n\n(Ghost enters)\n\nBARNARDO:\nIt looks just like the dead king.\n\nMARCELLUS:\nYou're educated, talk to it, Horatio.\n\nBARNARDO:\nDoesn't it look like the king? Pay attention, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO:\nMost likely. It fills me with fear and wonder.\n\nBARNARDO:\nIt wants to be spoken to.\n\nMARCELLUS:\nAsk it a question, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO:\nWho are you that appears at this time of night,\nwith the same appearance as the dead king?\nThe king of Denmark who used to march with majesty.\nBy heaven, I command you to speak.\n\nMARCELLUS:\nIt's angry.\n\nBARNARDO:\nLook, it's walking away.\n\nHORATIO:\nWait! Speak, speak! I command you to speak!\n\n(Ghost exits)\n\nMARCELLUS:\nIt's gone and won't answer.\n\nBARNARDO:\nWhat's wrong, Horatio? You're trembling and pale.\nIsn't this more than just imagination?\nWhat do you think about it?\n\nHORATIO:\nI swear to God, I wouldn't believe this\nwithout seeing it with my own eyes.\n\nMARCELLUS:\nDoesn't it look like the king?\n\nHORATIO:\nJust like him to himself.\nThat's exactly the armor he wore\nwhen he fought against Norway.\nHe frowned like that once, when he angrily attacked\nthe Polish soldiers on the ice.\nIt's strange.\n\nMARCELLUS:\nThis has happened twice before, at this same time,\nthe ghost has walked by our watch with a military stride.\n\nHORATIO:\nI don't know what he's thinking,\nbut from what I can gather,\nit's a sign that something strange is going to happen in our state.\n\nMARCELLUS:\nCome on, sit down and tell me, if you know,\nwhy this strict and watchful guard\nworks so hard every night for the country,\nand why there are constant shipments of weapons,\nand why there are so many shipwrights working,\neven on Sundays.\nWhat could be happening that requires such urgency,\nmaking the night work as hard as the day?\nWho can tell me?\n\nHORATIO:\nI can.\nAt least, that's what people are saying. Our last king,\nwhose image just appeared to us,\nwas challenged to a fight by Fortinbras of Norway,\nwho was driven by great ambition.\nIn that fight, our brave Hamlet,\nwho is highly respected in our part of the world,\nkilled Fortinbras. As a result,\nFortinbras lost all the lands he possessed,\nwhich were then seized by our king.\nA portion of those lands,\nas agreed upon by our king,\nwould have been returned to Fortinbras\nif he had won the fight.\nBut according to the terms of the agreement,\nthe lands fell to Hamlet. Now, young Fortinbras,\nfull of untapped potential and ambition,\nhas gathered a group of lawless rebels,\nfor some purpose that we can only guess,\nto forcefully regain those lands\nthat his father lost. And I believe\nthis is the main reason for our preparations,\nthe reason for our watch, and the main cause\nof all the rush and activity in the country."
