> _FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO_

**BERNARDO**

> Who's there?  

**FRANCISCO**

> No, tell me: stop, and reveal yourself.  

**BERNARDO**

> Long live the king!  

**FRANCISCO**

> Bernardo?  

**BERNARDO**

> Yes.  

**FRANCISCO**

> You've arrived just in time.  

**BERNARDO**

> It's now midnight; go to bed, Francisco.  

**FRANCISCO**

> Thanks for this break; it's freezing cold,  
> And I'm feeling sick.  

**BERNARDO**

> Have you had a peaceful watch?  

**FRANCISCO**

> Not a sound from anyone.  

**BERNARDO**

> Well, good night.  
> If you run into Horatio and Marcellus,  
> The ones who relieve me, tell them to hurry.  

**FRANCISCO**

> I think I hear them. Wait! Who's there?  
> 
> _Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS_

**HORATIO**

> We're friends of this place.  

**MARCELLUS**

> And loyal to the Danish king.  

**FRANCISCO**

> Good night to you.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Oh, goodbye, honest soldier:  
> Who has replaced you?  

**FRANCISCO**

> Bernardo has taken my place.  
> Good night to you.  
> 
> _Exit_

**MARCELLUS**

> Hello! Bernardo!  

**BERNARDO**

> Tell me,  
> Is Horatio there?  

**HORATIO**

> A part of him.  

**BERNARDO**

> Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Has this thing appeared again tonight?  

**BERNARDO**

> I haven't seen anything.  

**MARCELLUS**

Objective: Translate a selected passage from Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' into modern English.

> Horatio says it's just our imagination,
> And he won't let himself believe
> In this terrifying sight we've seen twice.
> That's why I've asked him to come with us
> To watch the events of this night,
> So that if this ghost appears again,
> He can confirm what we see and talk to it.

**HORATIO**

> Pff, pff, it won't appear.

**BERNARDO**

> Sit down for a moment;
> And let us once again tell you our story,
> Which you are so skeptical about,
> What we saw on two nights.

**HORATIO**

> Well, let's sit down,
> And let us hear Bernardo talk about this.

**BERNARDO**

> Last night,
> When that same star in the west
> Had finished its course to light up that part of the sky
> Where it now burns, Marcellus and I,
> When the clock struck one,--
> 
> _Enter Ghost_

**MARCELLUS**

> Quiet, stop talking; look, it's coming again!

**BERNARDO**

> In the same form, like the dead king.

**MARCELLUS**

> You're a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

**BERNARDO**

> Doesn't it look like the king? Look at it, Horatio.

**HORATIO**

> Most likely: it terrifies me with fear and wonder.

**BERNARDO**

> It wants to be spoken to.

**MARCELLUS**

> Question it, Horatio.

**HORATIO**

> Who are you that appears at this time of night,
> In the appearance of the majestic form
> In which the late king of Denmark used to march?
> By heaven, I command you, speak!

**MARCELLUS**

> It is offended.

**BERNARDO**

> Look, it's walking away!

**HORATIO**

> Wait! Speak, speak! I command you, speak!
> 
> _Exit Ghost_

**MARCELLUS**

> It's gone, and it won't answer.

**BERNARDO**

> HORATIO: 
> Hey Horatio, you're shaking and looking pale. 
> Isn't this something more than just imagination? 
> What do you think about it?

**HORATIO**: 
> I swear to God, I wouldn't believe this 
> Without seeing it with my own eyes. 

**MARCELLUS**: 
> Doesn't he look like the king?

**HORATIO**: 
> Just like you look like yourself. 
> He's wearing the same armor 
> That he wore when he fought against Norway; 
> He frowned like this once before, 
> When he struck the Polish soldiers on the ice. 
> It's strange.

**MARCELLUS**: 
> This has happened twice before, at this same hour, 
> He's walked by our guard with a military stride.

**HORATIO**: 
> I don't know what he's thinking specifically, 
> But overall, in my opinion, 
> This is a sign of some strange disruption in our state.

**MARCELLUS**: 
> Come on, sit down and tell me, you who knows, 
> Why this strict and vigilant watch 
> Works tirelessly every night for the sake of the kingdom, 
> And why there are daily inspections of weapons, 
> And a constant flow of foreign supplies for war. 
> Why there are so many shipbuilders, 
> Who don't even take Sundays off from their hard work. 
> What's going on, that this sweaty haste 
> Makes the night work as hard as the day? 
> Who can tell me?
