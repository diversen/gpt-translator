# The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark

### ACT I

### SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

> _FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO_

**BERNARDO**

> Who's there?  

**FRANCISCO**

> No, answer me: stop and reveal yourself.  

**BERNARDO**

> Long live the king!  

**FRANCISCO**

> Bernardo?  

**BERNARDO**

> Yes.  

**FRANCISCO**

> You arrive most punctually.  

**BERNARDO**

> It is now midnight; go to bed, Francisco.  

**FRANCISCO**

> Thank you for this break; it's bitterly cold,  
> And I am sick at heart.  

**BERNARDO**

> Have you had a quiet watch?  

**FRANCISCO**

> Not a mouse is stirring.  

**BERNARDO**

> Well, good night.  
> If you come across Horatio and Marcellus,  
> The others on watch with me, tell them to hurry.  

**FRANCISCO**

> I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?  
> 
> _Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS_

**HORATIO**

> Friends of this place.  

**MARCELLUS**

> And loyal to the Danish king.  

**FRANCISCO**

> Good night to you.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Farewell, honest soldier:  
> Who has relieved you?  

**FRANCISCO**

> Bernardo has taken my place.  
> Good night to you.  
> 
> _Exit_

**MARCELLUS**

> Hey! Bernardo!  

**BERNARDO**

> Tell me,  
> Is Horatio there?  

**HORATIO**

> Only a part of him.  

**BERNARDO**

> Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Has this thing appeared again tonight?  

**BERNARDO**

> I haven't seen anything.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Horatio says it's just our imagination,  
> And he won't believe in this feared sight  
> That we've seen twice before:  
> So I've asked him to join us  
> To watch the minutes of this night;  
> So that if this apparition appears again,  
> He can confirm what we see and speak to it.

**HORATIO**

> Pfft, pfft, it won't show up.

**BERNARDO**

> Sit down for a while;
> And let us once again tell you the story,
> That you are so resistant to hearing,
> What we saw two nights ago.

**HORATIO**

> Well, let's sit down,
> And let us hear Bernardo tell about this.

**BERNARDO**

> Last night,
> When that same star in the west
> Had finished its journey to light up that part of the sky
> Where it is now shining, Marcellus and I,
> The clock then struck one,
> 
> _Enter Ghost_

**MARCELLUS**

> Quiet, stop talking; look, there it comes again!

**BERNARDO**

> In the same form, like the dead king.

**MARCELLUS**

> You are a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

**BERNARDO**

> Doesn't it look like the king? Look at it, Horatio.

**HORATIO**

> Most likely: it fills me with fear and wonder.

**BERNARDO**

> It wants to be spoken to.

**MARCELLUS**

> Question it, Horatio.

**HORATIO**

> Who are you that appear at this time of night,
> With that noble and warlike appearance,
> In which the greatness of buried Denmark
> Once marched? I swear to you by God, speak!

**MARCELLUS**

> It is offended.

**BERNARDO**

> Look, it's walking away!

**HORATIO**

> Wait! Speak, speak! I command you, speak!
> 
> _Exit Ghost_

**MARCELLUS**

> It's gone, and won't answer.

**BERNARDO**

> What's wrong, Horatio! You're trembling and pale:
> Isn't this something more than just imagination?
> What do you think?

**HORATIO**

> I swear to God, I wouldn't have believed it
> Without seeing it with my own eyes,
> And having proof that it's true.

**MARCELLUS**

> Isn't it like the king?

**HORATIO**

> Just as you are to yourself:
> He was wearing the exact same armor
> When he fought against ambitious Norway;
> He frowned like that once, when, in an angry dispute,
> He attacked the Polish invaders on the ice.
> It's strange.
