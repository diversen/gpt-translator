# The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark

### ACT I

### SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

> _FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO_

**BERNARDO**

> Who's there?  

**FRANCISCO**

> No, tell me: stop, and reveal yourself.  

**BERNARDO**

> Long live the king!  

**FRANCISCO**

> Bernardo?  

**BERNARDO**

> Yes.  

**FRANCISCO**

> You come most punctually at your scheduled time.  

**BERNARDO**

> It is now twelve o'clock; go to bed, Francisco.  

**FRANCISCO**

> I am very grateful for this relief: it's bitterly cold,  
> And I am sick at heart.  

**BERNARDO**

> Have you had a peaceful watch?  

**FRANCISCO**

> Not a mouse is stirring.  

**BERNARDO**

> Well, good night.  
> If you happen to meet Horatio and Marcellus,  
> The companions of my watch, tell them to hurry.  

**FRANCISCO**

> I think I hear them. Stop, who's there?  
> 
> _Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS_

**HORATIO**

> Friends of this place.  

**MARCELLUS**

> And loyal to the Danish ruler.  

**FRANCISCO**

> Good night to you.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Oh, farewell, honest soldier:  
> Who has taken over your post?  

**FRANCISCO**

> Bernardo has taken my place.  
> Good night to you.  
> 
> _Exit_

**MARCELLUS**

> Hey! Bernardo!  

**BERNARDO**

> Tell me,  
> Is Horatio there?  

**HORATIO**

> A part of him.  

**BERNARDO**

> Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Has this thing appeared again tonight?  

**BERNARDO**

> I have seen nothing.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Horatio says it is just our imagination,  
> And he will not believe in this feared sight  
> That we have seen twice:  
> Therefore I have asked him  
> To stay with us and watch the minutes of this night;  
> So that if this apparition comes again,  
> He can confirm what we see and speak to it.

**HORATIO**

> Come on, come on, it won't show itself.  

**BERNARDO**

> Sit down for a moment;  
> And let us once again tell you the story,  
> That you are so closed off to hearing  
> What we saw two nights ago.  

**HORATIO**

> Well, let's sit down,  
> And let us hear Bernardo speak about this.  

**BERNARDO**

> Last night,  
> When that same star in the west  
> Had completed its journey to light up that part of the sky  
> Where it now burns, Marcellus and I,  
> The bell then striking one,--  
> 
> _Enter Ghost_

**MARCELLUS**

> Quiet, stop talking; look, it's coming again!  

**BERNARDO**

> In the same shape, like the dead king.  

**MARCELLUS**

> You are a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.  

**BERNARDO**

> Doesn't it look like the king? Look at it, Horatio.  

**HORATIO**

> Most likely: it fills me with fear and wonder.  

**BERNARDO**

> It wants to be spoken to.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Ask it a question, Horatio.  

**HORATIO**

> Who are you that appears at this time of night,  
> Along with that noble and warrior-like figure  
> In which the greatness of buried Denmark  
> Used to march? I swear by heaven, speak!  

**MARCELLUS**

> It is offended.  

**BERNARDO**

> Look, it's walking away!  

**HORATIO**

> Wait! Speak, speak! I command you, speak!  
> 
> _Exit Ghost_

**MARCELLUS**

> It's gone, and won't respond.  

**BERNARDO**

> What's the matter, Horatio! You're trembling and pale:  
> Isn't this something more than fantasy?  
> What do you think of it?  

**HORATIO**

> Before God, I couldn't believe this  
> Without the clear and true evidence  
> Of my own eyes.  

**MARCELLUS**

> Isn't it like the king?  

**HORATIO**

> Just as you are to yourself:  
> That was the exact armor he wore  
> When he fought against ambitious Norway;  
> He frowned like that once, when, in an angry dispute,  
> He struck the sledded Polacks on the ice.  
> It's strange.
