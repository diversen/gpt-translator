    "Scene I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.\n\nEnter Francisco and Barnardo, two guards.\n\nBARNARDO.\nWho's there?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nNo, tell me. Stand and show yourself.\n\nBARNARDO.\nLong live the King!\n\nFRANCISCO.\nBarnardo?\n\nBARNARDO.\nYes.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nYou're right on time.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIt's twelve o'clock now. Go to bed, Francisco.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nThanks for taking over. It's freezing out here,\nAnd I feel sick.\n\nBARNARDO.\nDid you have a quiet shift?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nNot a sound, not even a mouse.\n\nBARNARDO.\nAlright, good night.\nIf you see Horatio and Marcellus,\nThe guys who take over from me, tell them to hurry up.\n\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nI think I hear them. Stop! Who's there?\n\nHORATIO.\nWe're friends of this place.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nAnd loyal to the King.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nGood night to you.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nGoodbye, honest soldier. Who relieved you?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nBarnardo took over. Good night to you.\n\n[Exit]\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHey, Barnardo!\n\nBARNARDO.\nTell me, is Horatio there?\n\nHORATIO.\nSort of.\n\nBARNARDO.\nWelcome, Horatio. Welcome, Marcellus.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHas that thing appeared again tonight?\n\nBARNARDO.\nI haven't seen anything.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHoratio thinks it's just our imagination,\nAnd he doesn't believe in this ghost we've seen twice.\nSo I asked him to join us tonight\nTo watch and see if it appears again,\nSo he can see it and talk to it.\n\nHORATIO.\nNah, it won't show up.\n\nBARNARDO.\nSit down for a moment,\nAnd let us tell you again,\nEven though you don't believe us,\nWhat we've seen these past two nights.\n\nHORATIO.\nAlright, let's sit down.\nBarnardo, go ahead and tell us.\n\nBARNARDO.\nLast night,\nWhen that same star in the west,\nLit up that part of the sky\nWhere it's shining now, Marcellus and I,\nThe bell struck one--\n\nMARCELLUS.\nQuiet, stop talking. Look, it's coming again.\n\nEnter Ghost.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIn the same form, like the dead King.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nYou're a scholar, talk to it, Horatio.\n\nBARNARDO.\nDoesn't it look like the King? Pay attention, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO.\nMost likely. It makes me afraid and curious.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIt wants to be spoken to.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nAsk it a question, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO.\nWho are you, appearing at this time of night,\nWith the appearance of the late King of Denmark,\nWho used to lead our armies? By heaven, I demand you to speak.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nIt's angry.\n\nBARNARDO.\nLook, it's walking away.\n\nHORATIO.\nWait! Speak, speak! I command you to speak!\n\n[Exit Ghost]\n\nMARCELLUS.\nIt's gone, and it won't answer.\n\nBARNARDO.\nWhat's wrong, Horatio? You're trembling and pale.\nIsn't this more than just imagination?\nWhat do you think?\n\nHORATIO.\nI swear to God, I wouldn't believe it\nIf I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nDoesn't it look like the King?\n\nHORATIO.\nIt's as real as you are to yourself.\nIt's wearing the same armor he wore\nWhen he fought against Norway.\nI remember him frowning like that\nWhen he argued with the Polish soldiers on the ice.\nIt's strange.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nIt has appeared twice before, at this same hour,\nWalking by our watch.\n\nHORATIO.\nI don't know what it's planning,\nBut from what I can gather,\nSomething big and dangerous is about to happen to our country.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nCome on, sit down and tell me,\nIf you know, why this strict watch\nIs happening every night,\nAnd why so many cannons are being prepared for war,\nAnd why there are so many shipbuilders working,\nEven on Sundays.\nWhat's going on that everyone is in such a hurry,\nWorking day and night?\nWho can tell me?",
    "HORATIO.\nLet me explain it to you;\nAt least, this is what people are saying. Our previous King,\nWhose image we just saw,\nWas killed in a battle with Fortinbras of Norway,\nBecause Fortinbras was driven by a strong desire to prove himself,\nHe dared to fight; and in that battle, our brave Hamlet,\nWho is highly esteemed in our part of the world,\nKilled Fortinbras. By a sealed agreement,\nThat was recognized by law and heraldry,\nFortinbras forfeited all the lands he possessed\nTo the conqueror, our King;\nA portion of those lands was pledged\nBy our King, and would have been returned\nTo Fortinbras if he had won the battle;\nBut according to the same agreement,\nThe lands went to Hamlet. Now, young Fortinbras,\nWho is inexperienced but ambitious,\nHas gathered a group of lawless men\nIn Norway, to carry out a plan\nThat requires a lot of courage; which is, as it seems,\nTo forcefully take back those lands\nThat his father lost. And I believe\nThis is the main reason for our preparations,\nThe reason we are on watch, and the main cause\nOf our haste and search throughout the land.\n\nBARNARDO.\nI think it's no other than that:\nIt makes sense that this ghostly figure\nIs coming towards us, dressed like the King\nWho was the cause of these wars, and is still a mystery.\n\nHORATIO.\nIt's like a vision that troubles the mind.\nIn ancient Rome, when it was at its height and most powerful,\nShortly before the mighty Julius Caesar fell,\nThe graves were empty and the dead, wrapped in sheets,\nCould be heard whispering and chattering in the streets;\nThere were shooting stars and bloody rain,\nDisasters in the sun; and the moon,\nWhich controls the tides ruled by Neptune,\nWas sick and almost darkened, as if it were doomsday.\nAnd even similar events that foretell terrible things,\nLike signs that come before a prophecy comes true,\nHave been shown to our country and people\nBy both heaven and earth.\n\n[The Ghost enters again.]\n\nBut wait, look! There it is again!\nI'll confront it, even if it kills me. Wait, illusion!\nIf you can make any sound, or speak,\nTalk to me.\nIf there's anything good that can be done,\nThat can bring you ease and grace to me,\nSpeak to me.\nIf you know what will happen to your country,\nAnd if you can prevent it by telling us,\nOh, speak!\nOr if you have hidden treasures on earth,\nFor which, they say, spirits often walk in death,\nTell me about it. Wait, and speak!\n\n[The rooster crows.]\n\nStop it, Marcellus!\n\nMARCELLUS.\nShould I attack it with my weapon?\n\nHORATIO.\nGo ahead, if it doesn't disappear.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIt's still here!\n\nHORATIO.\nIt's still here!\n\n[The Ghost exits.]\n\nMARCELLUS.\nIt's gone!\nWe're wrong to try to harm something so majestic,\nBecause it's like air, invulnerable,\nAnd our attempts to harm it are just mockery.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIt was about to speak, when the rooster crowed.\n\nHORATIO.\nAnd then it vanished, like a guilty thing\nSummoned to appear before a judge. I've heard\nThat the rooster, who announces the morning,\nWakes up the sun god with its loud and shrill call;\nAnd when that happens,\nWhether it's in the sea or fire, on land or in the air,\nThe wandering and restless spirit\nReturns to its realm. And this present object\nProves that this is true.\n\nMARCELLUS.\nIt disappeared when the rooster crowed.\nSome people say that every time\nThe season when our Savior's birth is celebrated comes,\nThe bird of dawn sings all night long;\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dares to roam around,\nThe nights are peaceful, no planets cause harm,\nNo fairy takes anyone, and no witch has the power to cast a spell;\nThat's how holy and blessed that time is.\n\nHORATIO.\nI've heard the same, and I partly believe it.\nBut look, the morning is coming, dressed in a red cloak,\nWalking over the dew on that high hill in the east.\nLet's end our watch, and, in my opinion,\nLet's tell young Hamlet what we've seen tonight;\nBecause I'm sure this silent spirit will speak to him.\nDo you agree that we should tell him,\nAs an act of love and duty?",
    "MARCELLUS.\nLet's do it, I pray, and I know this morning\nWhere we can conveniently find him.\n\n[They exit.]\n\nSCENE II. Elsinore. A grand room in the Castle.\n\nClaudius, the King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords and Attendants enter.\n\nKING.\nEven though the memory of our dear brother Hamlet's death is still fresh, and it is fitting for us to mourn and for our whole kingdom to be in sorrow,\nWe have managed to control our grief and think of him with wise sorrow,\nalong with remembering ourselves.\nTherefore, our former sister, now our queen,\nwho is the rightful wife of this warlike state,\nwe have married her with mixed emotions,\nwith one eye filled with joy and one with tears,\nwith celebration and mourning,\nbalancing happiness and sorrow equally.\nWe have not disregarded your wisdom in this matter,\nwhich you have freely supported.\nThank you all.\nNow, you should know about young Fortinbras,\nwho, thinking our state is weak after the recent death of our dear brother,\nhas been bothering us with messages,\ndemanding the surrender of the lands his father lost,\naccording to the law.\nThat's enough about him.\nNow, for ourselves and for this meeting:\nWe have written to the uncle of young Fortinbras, the King of Norway,\nwho is old and weak, and barely hears anything about his nephew's plans,\nto stop him from taking any further action.\nSince all the preparations have been made\nfrom his territory, we are sending you, Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\nto deliver this message to old Norway.\nYou have no personal power beyond what is allowed by these instructions.\nFarewell, and let your haste show your duty.\n\nCORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.\nWe will do our duty in all things.\n\nKING.\nWe have no doubt about it. Farewell.\n\n[Cornelius and Voltemand exit.]\n\nAnd now, Laertes, what is your news?\nYou mentioned some request. What is it, Laertes?\nYou cannot speak freely to the king and lose your voice.\nWhat do you want, Laertes,\nthat I would not offer you, but you have to ask for?\nDenmark is as important to your father as his own body.\nWhat do you desire, Laertes?\n\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I humbly ask for your permission and favor\nto return to France.\nAlthough I willingly came to Denmark\nto show my duty at your coronation,\nnow that my duty is done,\nmy thoughts and wishes turn back to France,\nand I bow to your gracious permission and pardon.\n\nKING.\nDo you have your father's permission? What does Polonius say?\n\nPOLONIUS.\nHe does, my lord. I had to give it reluctantly\nafter his persistent request. I finally agreed.\nI beg you to grant him permission to go.\n\nKING.\nTake your time, Laertes. It's up to you,\nand use your best qualities as you wish!\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—\n\nHAMLET.\n[Aside.] More than just a relative, but not truly family.\n\nKING.\nWhy do you still seem troubled, Hamlet?\n\nHAMLET.\nNot so, my lord. I am too exposed to the sun.\n\nQUEEN.\nGood Hamlet, shake off your dark mood,\nand let your eyes look kindly upon Denmark.\nDon't keep searching for your noble father in the dust forever.\nYou know that death is common, and everyone must die,\npassing through nature to eternity.\n\nHAMLET.\nYes, madam, it is common.\n\nQUEEN.\nIf that's the case,\nwhy does it seem so personal to you?\n\nHAMLET.\nSeems, madam! No, it is personal. I don't pretend.\nIt's not just my black cloak, good mother,\nor the formal black attire,\nor the forced sighs and tears,\nor the river of tears in my eyes,\nor the sad expression on my face.\nAll these things may seem like signs of grief,\nbut they are just outward actions.\nI have something within me that surpasses appearances.\nThese are just the decorations and symbols of sorrow.",
    "KING:\nIt's good and commendable of you, Hamlet,\nTo mourn for your father;\nBut you should know, your father lost his father,\nThat father lost his, and the one who survived\nIs obligated to mourn for a certain time.\nBut to continue in stubborn sorrow\nIs impious and unmanly.\nIt shows a will that is incorrect to heaven,\nA weak heart, an impatient mind,\nAn ignorant and unschooled understanding.\nWe all know that death is common,\nAs common as anything that can be sensed.\nSo why should we oppose it and take it to heart?\nFie! It's a fault against heaven,\nA fault against the dead, a fault against nature,\nAnd an absurd way of thinking.\nDeath of fathers is a common theme,\nAnd it has always been this way.\nWe ask you to let go of this overwhelming grief,\nAnd think of us as a father figure.\nThe world should take note\nThat you are next in line for the throne,\nAnd I love you just as much as a father loves his son.\nYour decision to go back to school in Wittenberg\nGoes against what we desire.\nWe urge you to stay here,\nIn the comfort and happiness of our presence,\nAs our closest advisor, cousin, and son.\n\nQUEEN:\nDon't disappoint your mother, Hamlet.\nI beg you to stay with us and not go to Wittenberg.\n\nHAMLET:\nI will obey you, madam, to the best of my ability.\n\nKING:\nThat's a loving and fair response.\nBe yourself here in Denmark. Madam, let's go.\nHamlet's agreement brings joy to my heart.\nAs a celebration, let the cannons in Denmark\nAnnounce to the heavens,\nAnd let the heavens respond with thunder.\nLet's go.\n\n[Everyone exits except Hamlet.]\n\nHAMLET:\nOh, I wish my body could melt away,\nDisappear like dew!\nOr that God hadn't forbidden\nSuicide. Oh God! Oh God!\nEverything in this world\nSeems tiresome, dull, and meaningless to me.\nFie on it! It's like an overgrown, neglected garden,\nFull of disgusting things. How did it come to this?\nMy father died only two months ago,\nNo, not even two months:\nHe was such a great king,\nLike a god compared to a beast.\nHe loved my mother so much\nThat he wouldn't let the winds of heaven\nHarm her face. Heaven and earth!\nMust I remember? She clung to him\nAs if her desire for him grew\nEvery time she saw him. And yet, within a month—\nI can't think about it—Women, your name is frailty!\nIn just a month, before her shoes were even worn out\nFrom following my father's body, crying like Niobe—\nShe, yes, she—\nOh God! Even an irrational animal\nWould have mourned longer. She married\nMy uncle, my father's brother. But he is nothing like my father.\nWithin a month?\nBefore the tears had dried from her eyes,\nShe married him. It was so quick,\nIt's not right, and it won't end well.\nBut it breaks my heart, because I must remain silent.\n\nEnter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.\n\nHORATIO:\nGreetings, my lord!\n\nHAMLET:\nI'm glad to see you well.\nHoratio, I hope I haven't forgotten myself.\n\nHORATIO:\nIt's me, my lord,\nYour humble servant, as always.\n\nHAMLET:\nSir, my good friend;\nI'll call you by that name.\nAnd what brings you here from Wittenberg, Horatio?—\nMarcellus?\n\nMARCELLUS:\nYes, my lord.\n\nHAMLET:\nI'm very glad to see you. Good evening, sir.\nBut really, what brings you here from Wittenberg?\n\nHORATIO:\nI just needed a break, my lord.\n\nHAMLET:\nI wouldn't want to hear your enemies say that about you.\nAnd I won't let you make me doubt you,\nTo make me believe your own negative reports.\nI know you're not someone who skips out on responsibilities.\nBut what is your business in Elsinore?\nWe'll make sure you have a good time before you leave.",
    "HORATIO.\nMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.\n\nHAMLET.\nPlease don't make fun of me, my friend. I think you came to see my mother's wedding.\n\nHORATIO.\nIndeed, my lord, it happened soon after.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow strange! The food that was meant for the funeral was used for the wedding feast. I wish I had gone to heaven before seeing that day. My father... I can still see my father.\n\nHORATIO.\nWhere, my lord?\n\nHAMLET.\nIn my mind, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO.\nI saw him once; he was a great king.\n\nHAMLET.\nHe was just a man, but there will never be anyone like him again.\n\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I think I saw him last night.\n\nHAMLET.\nSaw who?\n\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, your father, the King.\n\nHAMLET.\nMy father, the King!\n\nHORATIO.\nListen carefully and I will tell you what happened. These two gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, were on watch for two nights in the middle of the night. They saw a figure that looked exactly like your father, fully armed. He walked slowly and majestically right by them, three times. They were terrified and couldn't speak. They told me about it in secret, and I saw it myself on the third night. Everything they had described was true. I knew it was your father; the resemblance was uncanny.\n\nHAMLET.\nBut where did this happen?\n\nMARCELLUS.\nMy lord, on the platform where we were keeping watch.\n\nHAMLET.\nDid you talk to it?\n\nHORATIO.\nYes, my lord, I did. But it didn't respond. Although, at one point, it seemed like it was about to speak. But then, the rooster crowed and it disappeared.\n\nHAMLET.\nThat's very strange.\n\nHORATIO.\nI swear, my honored lord, it's true. We thought it was our duty to tell you about it.\n\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, it troubles me. Will you be on watch tonight?\n\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nYes, my lord.\n\nHAMLET.\nAnd was it armed?\n\nBoth.\nYes, my lord.\n\nHAMLET.\nFrom head to toe?\n\nBOTH.\nYes, my lord.\n\nHAMLET.\nDid you see its face?\n\nHORATIO.\nYes, my lord, it had its helmet on.\n\nHAMLET.\nDid it look angry?\n\nHORATIO.\nIts face showed more sorrow than anger.\n\nHAMLET.\nWas it pale or red?\n\nHORATIO.\nNo, very pale.\n\nHAMLET.\nAnd did it keep staring at you?\n\nHORATIO.\nYes, constantly.\n\nHAMLET.\nI wish I had been there.\n\nHORATIO.\nIt would have amazed you.\n\nHAMLET.\nVery likely. Did it stay for a long time?\n\nHORATIO.\nAbout as long as it takes to count to a hundred.\n\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nLonger, longer.\n\nHORATIO.\nNot when I saw it.\n\nHAMLET.\nWas its beard gray?\n\nHORATIO.\nYes, it was just like I had seen it in his life, a dark gray.\n\nHAMLET.\nI will keep watch tonight. Maybe it will appear again.\n\nHORATIO.\nI'm sure it will.\n\nHAMLET.\nIf it takes the form of my noble father, I will speak to it, even if it seems like it's from hell. I beg you all, if you have kept this sighting a secret until now, continue to do so. And whatever else happens tonight, understand it but don't speak of it. I will repay your loyalty. Farewell to all of you. I will visit you on the platform between eleven and twelve.\n\nALL.\nWe are devoted to you, my lord.\n\nHAMLET.\nAnd I am devoted to you. Goodbye.\n\n[Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo exit.]"
