    "Once upon a time, in a place called Bloemfontein, South Africa, there was a hotel called The Orange Hotel. It was located near a railway station on High Street. Now, let me tell you about a very strange and spooky day that happened there.\n\nIt was a freezing cold Sunday on January 24, 1932, and in a room on the hotel's third floor, four men were shaking with fear. Can you imagine that? Let's meet these brave (or maybe not so brave) men. First, there was George C. Titteridge, the owner of the hotel. Then, we had police constable Ian De Witt from the Central Station. Next, there was Johannes Bogaert, who was the local coroner. And lastly, we had Dr. Cornelius Van Keulen, who was the coroner's physician. He seemed to be the most composed out of the group, but don't worry, even he was still scared!\n\nNow, let's talk about what was going on in the room. It was a hot summer day, but these men couldn't even enjoy the warmth because there was something much scarier than the heat. You see, there was a dead body lying on the floor, but that wasn't what had everyone terrified. No, their eyes kept darting from the table, where there was a strange collection of things, to the ceiling above. On that smooth white ceiling, someone had somehow managed to scribble big, wobbly letters using ink. Can you imagine writing on a ceiling? It's not something you see every day! And every now and then, Dr. Van Keulen would sneak a peek at a worn-out leather book that he held tightly in his left hand. I wonder what secrets that book held?\n\nThe horror these four men felt was split between the mysterious book, the strange words on the ceiling, and even a dead fly that was floating in a bottle of ammonia on the table. Eww! But that's not all that was on the table. There was also an open inkwell, a pen, a writing pad, a doctor's medical case, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and a tumbler filled with black oxide of manganese. Quite the collection, huh? I wonder what these things had to do with the spooky situation.\n\nSo there they were, in that eerie room, trying to make sense of all these strange things. I hope they were able to figure it out and find some peace of mind. But for now, they were definitely in for a wild and spooky adventure!",
    "Once upon a time, there was this old book that belonged to a dead guy lying on the floor. The book was all worn out and had the name \"Frederick N. Mason, Mining Properties, Toronto, Canada\" written in it. But guess what? That name was a big fat lie! The book had some really scary stuff written in it, stuff that made your hair stand on end. And there were even scarier things hinted at, things that were so terrifying that you couldn't even fully believe them. \n\nNow, there were four guys who found this book, and they were used to dealing with creepy secrets in Africa. But even they couldn't help but shiver like crazy, despite the fact that it was hot as heck in January. I mean, imagine being so scared that not even the scorching heat can calm you down!\n\nAnyway, this book wasn't very big, and the writing inside was all fancy and neat at first. But as you kept reading, it got all messy and shaky. It wasn't really a diary, though. It was more like a record of one guy's activities. Dr. Van Keulen, one of the guys who found the book, recognized the dead guy's name right away. Turns out, he was a fancy doctor who knew a lot about Africa. But then, Dr. Van Keulen made a shocking discovery. The dead guy's name was connected to this horrible crime that nobody had been able to solve for months! And the more he read, the more horrified and grossed out he became. It was like a mix of terror, awe, and a desperate need to run away as fast as possible.",
    "THE DIARY OF\n\nTHOMAS SLAUENWITE, M.D.\n\nAbout How I'm Gonna Get Back at Henry Sargent Moore, Ph.D., from Brooklyn, New York, the Professor of Bugs at Columbia University, New York, N.Y. I'm Writing This to be Read After I'm Dead, Just So Everyone Knows How I Got My Revenge, Even if Nobody Believes Me.\n\nJanuary 5, 1929â€”So, I've decided that I'm gonna kill Dr. Henry Moore, and something that happened recently gave me a great idea on how to do it. From now on, I'm gonna stick to a plan of action, hence why I'm starting this diary.\n\nI won't bother going over all the reasons that led me to this point, 'cause the people who know what's going on already know all the important details. I was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on April 12, 1885, to Dr. Paul Slauenwite, who used to live in Pretoria, South Africa. Medicine runs in my family, and my dad (who died in 1916 while I was fighting in France with a South African regiment) encouraged me to specialize in African diseases. After graduating from Columbia, I spent a lot of time researching and traveling from Durban, in Natal, all the way up to the equator."
