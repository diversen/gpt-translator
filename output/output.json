    "### Winged Death\n\nI.\n\nThe Orange Hotel is located on High Street near the railway station in Bloemfontein, South Africa. On Sunday, January 24, 1932, four men sat trembling with fear in a room on the third floor. One was George C. Titteridge, the hotel owner; another was police constable Ian De Witt from the Central Station; a third was Johannes Bogaert, the local coroner; and the fourth, who seemed to be the most composed of the group, was Dr. Cornelius Van Keulen, the coroner's physician.\n\nOn the floor, uncomfortably noticeable in the oppressive summer heat, lay the body of a dead man—but this was not what frightened the four men. Their eyes shifted from the table, which held a strange collection of objects, to the ceiling above, where a series of large, shaky letters had somehow been scrawled in ink; and every now and then Dr. Van Keulen would sneak a glance at a worn leather notebook held in his left hand. The horror experienced by the four men was equally divided between the notebook, the scribbled words on the ceiling, and a peculiar-looking dead fly that floated in a bottle of ammonia on the table. Also on the table were an open inkwell, a pen and notepad, a medical case belonging to a physician, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and a tumbler containing about a quarter of black oxide of manganese.",
    "The old leather book was the journal of the dead man on the floor, and immediately made it clear that the name \"Frederick N. Mason, Mining Properties, Toronto, Canada\", signed in the hotel register, was a false one. There were other things—terrible things—which it also made clear; and still other things of even greater terror that it hinted at in a horrifying way without fully explaining or making them believable. It was the half-belief of the four men, nurtured by lives spent near the dark, hidden secrets of brooding Africa, that made them shiver so violently despite the scorching January heat.\n\nThe blank book was not very large, and the entries were written in a neat handwriting that became sloppy and anxious towards the end. It consisted of a series of notes initially spaced irregularly, but eventually becoming daily. It wouldn't be entirely accurate to call it a diary, as it only documented one aspect of the writer's activities. Dr. Van Keulen instantly recognized the name of the deceased as soon as he opened the cover, as it belonged to a well-known member of his own profession who had been extensively involved with African affairs. In another moment, he was horrified to discover that this name was connected to a heinous crime, officially unsolved, that had made headlines in the newspapers about four months prior. And the more he read, the stronger his horror, awe, disgust, and sense of panic grew.",
    "Here, in essence, is the text which the doctor read aloud in that eerie and increasingly foul-smelling room while the three men around him breathed heavily, squirmed in their chairs, and glanced fearfully at the ceiling, the table, the thing on the floor, and each other:\n\nJOURNAL OF\n\nTHOMAS SLAUENWITE, M.D.\n\nRegarding punishment of Henry Sargent Moore, Ph.D., of Brooklyn, New York, Professor of Invertebrate Biology in Columbia University, New York, N.Y. Prepared to be read after my death, to publicly reveal the achievement of my revenge, which may otherwise never be attributed to me even if it succeeds.\n\nJanuary 5, 1929—I have now fully resolved to kill Dr. Henry Moore, and a recent incident has shown me how I will do it. From now on, I will follow a consistent course of action; hence the beginning of this journal.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat the circumstances which have driven me to this path, as the informed part of the public is familiar with all the important facts. I was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on April 12, 1885, the son of Dr. Paul Slauenwite, formerly of Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. Studying medicine as part of my family tradition, I was led by my father (who died in 1916, while I was serving in France in a South African regiment) to specialize in African fevers; and after my graduation from Columbia spent much time in researches which took me from Durban, in Natal, up to the equator itself."
