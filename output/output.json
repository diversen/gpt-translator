    "SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.\n\nEnter Francisco and Barnardo, two guards.\n\nBARNARDO. Whoâ€™s there?\n\nFRANCISCO. Hey, answer me. Stop and show yourself.\n\nBARNARDO. Long live the King!\n\nFRANCISCO. Barnardo?\n\nBARNARDO. Yes, it's me.\n\nFRANCISCO. You're right on time.\n\nBARNARDO. It's twelve o'clock now. Go to bed, Francisco.\n\nFRANCISCO. Thanks for taking over. It's freezing and I feel sick.\n\nBARNARDO. Did you have a quiet shift?\n\nFRANCISCO. Not a sound.\n\nBARNARDO. Well, good night. If you see Horatio and Marcellus, the other guards, tell them to hurry.\n\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\n\nFRANCISCO. I think I hear them. Stop! Who's there?\n\nHORATIO. We're friends of this place.\n\nMARCELLUS. And loyal to the king.\n\nFRANCISCO. Good night to you.\n\nMARCELLUS. Farewell, honest soldier. Who relieved you?\n\nFRANCISCO. Barnardo took my place. Good night.\n\n[Exit]\n\nMARCELLUS. Hey, Barnardo!\n\nBARNARDO. What, is Horatio there?\n\nHORATIO. Only a part of him.\n\nBARNARDO. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, Marcellus.\n\nMARCELLUS. Has that thing appeared again tonight?\n\nBARNARDO. I haven't seen anything.\n\nMARCELLUS. Horatio thinks it's just our imagination and doesn't believe it. So, I asked him to join us tonight and watch. If the ghost appears again, he can confirm what we've seen.\n\nHORATIO. Oh, it won't appear.\n\nBARNARDO. Sit down and let us try to convince you, who don't believe our story, of what we have witnessed for two nights.\n\nHORATIO. Fine, let's sit and listen to Barnardo talk about this.\n\nBARNARDO. Last night, when that same star in the west had finished its course and illuminated the sky, Marcellus and I, when the bell struck one...\n\nMARCELLUS. Quiet, stop talking. Look, it's coming again.\n\nEnter Ghost.\n\nBARNARDO. It looks just like the dead king.\n\nMARCELLUS. You're a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.\n\nBARNARDO. Doesn't it look like the king? Pay attention, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO. Yes, it looks very similar. It fills me with fear and wonder.\n\nBARNARDO. It wants to be spoken to.\n\nMARCELLUS. Ask it something, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO. Who are you, appearing at this time of night? And why do you have the appearance of the great and powerful king of Denmark? By heaven, I command you to speak.\n\nMARCELLUS. It's offended.\n\nBARNARDO. Look, it's walking away.\n\nHORATIO. Wait! Speak, speak! I command you to speak!\n\n[Exit Ghost]\n\nMARCELLUS. It's gone and won't answer.\n\nBARNARDO. Horatio, what's wrong with you? You're trembling and pale. Isn't this more than just imagination? What do you think?\n\nHORATIO. I swear to God, I wouldn't believe it unless I saw it with my own eyes.\n\nMARCELLUS. Doesn't it look like the king?\n\nHORATIO. Yes, it does. Just like himself. This is the armor he wore when he fought against Norway. I remember the anger in his face when he attacked the Polish soldiers on the ice. It's strange.\n\nMARCELLUS. He has walked past our watch twice before, at this same hour.\n\nHORATIO. I don't know what it means specifically, but I have a feeling that something strange is about to happen to our country.\n\nMARCELLUS. Alright, sit down and tell me, if you know, why these guards are so strict and watchful every night. And why there are so many cannons and weapons being prepared for war. And why so many shipbuilders are working tirelessly, even on Sundays. Who can tell me what's going on?",
    "HORATIO. I can do that. At least, that's what people are saying. Our previous King, who we just saw a picture of, was killed by Fortinbras of Norway. Fortinbras was driven by pride to challenge our King to a fight. Our brave Hamlet, who is highly regarded in our part of the world, killed Fortinbras in the battle. According to a legal agreement, Fortinbras lost not only his life but also all his lands to the winner. Our King then pledged a portion of these lands to Fortinbras, which would have been returned to him if he had won. But, according to the terms of the agreement, they now belong to Hamlet. Now, young Fortinbras, who is eager for power and has gathered a group of lawless people in Norway, wants to forcefully take back those lands that his father lost. This is the main reason why we are preparing for war and why we are on high alert.\n\nBARNARDO. I think that's exactly what's happening. It makes sense that this mysterious figure resembles the previous King, who was the reason for the ongoing wars.\n\nHORATIO. It's something to trouble the mind. Just like in ancient Rome, before Julius Caesar fell, the graves were empty and the ghosts were heard in the streets. There were disasters in the sun, like stars with trails of fire and blood. The planet that influences the sea was almost sick enough to bring doomsday. These signs, both in heaven and on earth, have been shown to our people.\n\n[The Ghost reappears.]\n\nBut wait, look! There it is again! I'll approach it, even if it harms me. Stay, illusion! If you can make any sound or speak, do so. If there's anything good that can be done for you, and in turn for me, speak. If you know what will happen to our country, and if that knowledge can help us avoid it, speak! Or if you have hidden treasure buried in the ground, as spirits are said to do, speak about it. Stay, and speak!\n\n[The rooster crows.]\n\nStop it, Marcellus!\n\nMARCELLUS. Should I hit it with my weapon?\n\nHORATIO. Go ahead, if it doesn't disappear.\n\nBARNARDO. It's still here!\n\nHORATIO. It's still here!\n\n[The Ghost disappears.]\n\nMARCELLUS. It's gone! We were wrong to try to attack it, for it's as intangible as air, and our futile blows only mock it.\n\nBARNARDO. It was about to speak when the rooster crowed.\n\nHORATIO. And then it vanished, as if it were guilty and afraid of being caught. I've heard that the rooster, which announces the morning, wakes up the sun with its loud and piercing call. And at that signal, whether it's in the sea, the fire, the earth, or the air, wandering spirits return to their boundaries. The truth of this is evident in what just happened.\n\nMARCELLUS. It disappeared at the sound of the rooster. Some say that when the season of our Savior's birth is celebrated, the morning bird sings all night long. And during that time, no spirit dares to roam, the nights are safe, the planets do not cause harm, fairies do not play tricks, and witches lose their power. It's a sacred and blessed time.\n\nHORATIO. I've heard that too, and I partly believe it. But look, the morning is dressed in a red robe as it walks over the dew on that hill in the east. Let's end our watch and, in my opinion, let's tell young Hamlet what we've seen tonight. I believe this silent spirit will speak to him. Do you agree that we should inform him? It's necessary for our friendship and our duty.",
    "Scene I: Marcellus and another character are discussing finding someone.\n\nMarcellus: Let's do it, I pray, and I know this morning where we can find him most conveniently.\n\n[They exit.]\n\nScene II: A room in the castle where the King, Queen, Hamlet, and others are present.\n\nKing: Although the memory of our dear brother Hamlet's death is still fresh, and it is fitting for us to grieve, and for our entire kingdom to be filled with sorrow, we have tried to use our wisdom to balance our grief. We remember him and also think of ourselves. Therefore, our former sister, who is now our queen, we have married her with mixed emotions of joy and sadness, both celebrating and mourning at the same time. We have not excluded your better judgment in this decision. Thank you all. Now, let's talk about young Fortinbras. He mistakenly believes that our state is weak and vulnerable due to the death of our brother, and he has been bothering us with messages about reclaiming lands lost by his father. That's enough about him. Now, for ourselves and for this meeting: we have written a letter to the King of Norway, who is the uncle of young Fortinbras. He is old, weak, and barely able to hear, so we want to stop his nephew's plans. We are sending you, Cornelius and Voltemand, to deliver this message, but you do not have any personal power to negotiate beyond what is stated in the letter. Farewell, and make haste.\n\nCornelius and Voltemand: We will fulfill our duty, in everything.\n\nKing: We have no doubts about that. Farewell.\n\n[Cornelius and Voltemand exit.]\n\nNow, Laertes, what's going on with you? You mentioned having a request. What is it, Laertes? Speak up to the King, don't hold back. What do you want that I will not offer, but you do not have to ask for? Your father's position in Denmark is as important as the head is to the heart or the hand is to the mouth. What do you desire, Laertes?\n\nLaertes: My lord, I ask for your permission and favor to return to France. Although I willingly came to Denmark to show my loyalty during your coronation, now that my duty is done, my thoughts and wishes turn back to France. I bow to your gracious permission and forgiveness.\n\nKing: Did you ask for your father's permission? What does Polonius say?\n\nPolonius: He obtained my slow permission through persistent pleading, and eventually, I reluctantly agreed. I beg you to grant him permission to go.\n\nKing: Take your time, Laertes. Use it as you wish and make the most of it. But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son...\n\nHamlet: [Aside] A little more than family, but not really kindred.\n\nKing: Why do you still seem troubled, Hamlet?\n\nHamlet: Not so, my lord. I am just too exposed to the sun.\n\nQueen: Good Hamlet, get rid of your dark sadness and let your eyes show friendship towards Denmark. Don't always keep them closed, searching for your noble father in the dust. You know that death is a natural part of life, leading to eternity.\n\nHamlet: Yes, madam, it is a common truth.\n\nQueen: If that's the case, why does it affect you so deeply?\n\nHamlet: It's not just an appearance, madam. It's a reality. I don't only wear a black cloak, or put on a sad face, or sigh heavily. No, it's not just the tears in my eyes or the depressed expression on my face. All these outward signs of grief may seem like true indications of my state, but they are just superficial. I have something within me that goes beyond outward display. These external signs are just decorations and symbols of sorrow.",
    "KING: Hamlet, it's good and commendable of you to mourn your father, but you should know that your father also lost his own father, and the survivor is obligated to mourn for a period of time. But to continue mourning stubbornly is wrong. It's unmanly and shows a lack of willpower, strength, and understanding. Death is a natural part of life, so why should we be so opposed to it? It's a fault against heaven, the dead, and nature. It's absurd to argue against death, which has always been inevitable. We ask you to let go of this pointless grief and think of us as your father. You are next in line for the throne and we love you just as much as a father loves his son. Your decision to go back to school in Wittenberg goes against what we want. We beg you to stay here with us, as our closest advisor, cousin, and son.\n\nQUEEN: Hamlet, please don't ignore your mother's prayers. Stay with us and don't go to Wittenberg.\n\nHAMLET: I will do my best to obey you, mother.\n\nKING: That's a loving and fair response. Be like us here in Denmark. Now, let's go. Hamlet's agreement brings a smile to my heart. In celebration, let the cannons sound and the heavens echo with the King's toast. Come with me.\n\n[Everyone exits except for Hamlet.]\n\nHAMLET: Oh, I wish my flesh could melt away and disappear! Or that God hadn't forbidden suicide. Oh God! How tired, boring, and useless everything in this world seems to me! It's like an overgrown garden full of weeds and disgusting things. How did it come to this? He's been dead for only two months, not even two. He was such an excellent king, like a god compared to a beast. He loved my mother so much, he wouldn't even let the winds touch her face too harshly. Heaven and earth! Do I have to remember? She clung to him as if her desire for him grew with every touch. And yet, within a monthâ€”let me not think about itâ€”women are so weak! In just a month, before her mourning shoes had even worn out, she married my uncle. It's so wicked and fast, to rush into an incestuous relationship! This can't be good. But I have to keep quiet, even if it breaks my heart.\n\n(Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo enter.)\n\nHORATIO: Greetings, my lord!\n\nHAMLET: I'm glad to see you well, Horatio, I almost forgot myself.\n\nHORATIO: It's me, your loyal servant, Horatio.\n\nHAMLET: Sir, my good friend, I'll call you by a different name. What brings you here from Wittenberg, Horatio? And Marcellus?\n\nMARCELLUS: I'm here, my lord.\n\nHAMLET: I'm very glad to see you. Good evening, sir. But really, what are you doing here, coming all the way from Wittenberg?\n\nHORATIO: I just wanted to see your father's funeral, my lord.",
    "HAMLET. Please don't make fun of me, my friend. I think I saw my mother get married.\n\nHORATIO. Yes, my lord, it happened soon after that.\n\nHAMLET. What a strange coincidence, Horatio! The food that was supposed to be for the funeral was used at the wedding. I wish I had met my worst enemy in heaven before that day. My father... I can see my father in my mind.\n\nHORATIO. Where, my lord?\n\nHAMLET. In my imagination, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO. I saw him once; he was a great king.\n\nHAMLET. He was a man, overall, I won't see someone like him again.\n\nHORATIO. My lord, I think I saw him last night.\n\nHAMLET. Saw? Who?\n\nHORATIO. My lord, your father, the king.\n\nHAMLET. My father, the king!\n\nHORATIO. Calm down and listen carefully, until I can tell you what these gentlemen witnessed. \n\nHAMLET. Please, let me hear it.\n\nHORATIO. These two gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, had two nights in a row encountered something strange while on their watch in the middle of the night. A figure that looked exactly like your father, fully armed, appeared before them and walked slowly past them. He walked by them three times, so close that they could almost touch him, while they were frozen with fear and couldn't speak. They told me this in secret, and on the third night, I watched with them. Just as they described, the apparition appeared. I knew your father; this ghost looked exactly like him.\n\nHAMLET. But where did this happen?\n\nMARCELLUS. My lord, it happened on the platform where we were standing guard.\n\nHAMLET. Did you not speak to it?\n\nHORATIO. My lord, I did, but it didn't respond. However, at one point, it lifted its head as if it wanted to speak. But then the morning cock crowed loudly, and it quickly disappeared.\n\nHAMLET. That's very strange.\n\nHORATIO. I swear, my honored lord, it's true. We thought it was our duty to inform you.\n\nHAMLET. Indeed, indeed, gentlemen, this troubles me. Are you on duty tonight?\n\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO. Yes, my lord.\n\nHAMLET. And you are armed?\n\nBoth. Yes, my lord.\n\nHAMLET. Completely armed?\n\nBOTH. Yes, my lord, from head to foot.\n\nHAMLET. Then you did not see his face?\n\nHORATIO. Oh yes, my lord, he had his helmet on.\n\nHAMLET. Did he look angry?\n\nHORATIO. His expression was more sad than angry.\n\nHAMLET. Was he pale or red?\n\nHORATIO. Very pale.\n\nHAMLET. And did he stare at you?\n\nHORATIO. Constantly.\n\nHAMLET. I wish I had been there.\n\nHORATIO. It would have amazed you.\n\nHAMLET. Very likely, very likely. Did it stay there for a long time?\n\nHORATIO. It stayed for as long as it would take to count to a hundred with moderate speed.\n\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO. Longer, longer.\n\nHORATIO. Not when I saw it.\n\nHAMLET. Was his beard gray?\n\nHORATIO. Yes, it was, just like I remember it when he was alive.\n\nHAMLET. I will keep watch tonight. Maybe it will appear again.\n\nHORATIO. I'm sure it will.\n\nHAMLET. If it takes the form of my noble father, I will speak to it, even if hell itself tells me to be silent. I beg all of you, if you have kept this sighting a secret until now, continue to keep it a secret. And whatever else happens tonight, understand it but don't speak of it. I will repay your loyalty. So, goodbye for now. I will visit you on the platform between eleven and twelve.\n\nALL. We are loyal to you, my lord.\n\nHAMLET. Your loyalty is reciprocated. Goodbye.\n\n[Exit Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.]\n\nMy father's spirit is armed! Something is not right; I suspect foul play. I wish it was night already! Until then, I will remain calm and wait. Evil deeds will eventually come to light, no matter how much they are hidden."
