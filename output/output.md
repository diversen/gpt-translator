ACT I

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two guards.

BARNARDO. Who's there?

FRANCISCO. No, answer me. Stop and show yourself.

BARNARDO. Long live the King!

FRANCISCO. Barnardo?

BARNARDO. Yes.

FRANCISCO. You're right on time.

BARNARDO. It's twelve o'clock. Go to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO. Thank you for relieving me. It's freezing and I feel sick.

BARNARDO. Did you have a quiet watch?

FRANCISCO. Not a sound.

BARNARDO. Alright, good night. If you see Horatio and Marcellus, the other guards, tell them to hurry.

Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

FRANCISCO. I think I hear them. Stop! Who is there?

HORATIO. We are friends of this place.

MARCELLUS. And loyal to the King.

FRANCISCO. Good night.

MARCELLUS. Goodbye, honest soldier. Who relieved you?

FRANCISCO. Barnardo took my place. Good night.

[_Exit._]

MARCELLUS. Hey, Barnardo!

BARNARDO. What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO. Only part of him.

BARNARDO. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS. Has that thing appeared again tonight?

BARNARDO. I haven't seen anything.

MARCELLUS. Horatio thinks it's just our imagination and doesn't believe it. That's why I asked him to join us tonight, so he can see it too and talk to it.

HORATIO. Psh, it won't appear.

BARNARDO. Sit down for a moment, and let us tell you again what we've seen these past two nights.

HORATIO. Alright, let's sit down and listen to Barnardo talk about this.

BARNARDO. Last night, when that star in the west had moved to light up that part of the sky where it is now, Marcellus and I, when the bell struck one--

MARCELLUS. Quiet, stop talking. Look, it's coming again.

Enter Ghost.

BARNARDO. It looks just like the dead King.

MARCELLUS. You're a scholar, talk to it, Horatio.

BARNARDO. Doesn't it look like the King? Pay attention, Horatio.

HORATIO. Yes, it does. It fills me with fear and wonder.

BARNARDO. It wants to be spoken to.

MARCELLUS. Ask it something, Horatio.

HORATIO. Who are you that appears at this time of night, and why do you have the appearance of the powerful and noble King of Denmark? By heaven, I command you to speak.

MARCELLUS. It's angry.

BARNARDO. Look, it's walking away.

HORATIO. Wait! Speak, speak! I command you to speak!

[_Exit Ghost._]

MARCELLUS. It's gone and won't answer.

BARNARDO. What's wrong, Horatio? You're trembling and pale. Isn't this more than just imagination? What do you think?

HORATIO. I swear to God, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

MARCELLUS. Does it not look like the King?

HORATIO. It looks just like him. That's the armor he wore when he fought against Norway; that's how he looked when he angrily attacked the Polish. It's strange.

MARCELLUS. This has happened twice before, at this same time, with a military stride, passing by us.

HORATIO. I don't know the details, but based on my opinion, something strange and dangerous is about to happen to our country.

MARCELLUS. Come on, sit down and tell me, if you know, why there's such a strict and watchful guard every night, why there are constant sounds of cannons and foreign ships preparing for war, why there are so many shipbuilders working day and night. What's going on that requires this intense activity? Who can tell me?

HORATIO. I can do that. At least, that's what people are saying. Our previous king, who we just saw the image of, was killed by Fortinbras of Norway. Fortinbras was driven by his pride to challenge our king to a fight. Our brave Hamlet, who is highly regarded in our part of the world, killed Fortinbras in the battle. According to a signed agreement and the rules of law and heraldry, Fortinbras forfeited his lands to the winner, our king. Half of those lands were pledged by our king and would have gone back to Fortinbras if he had won. Now, young Fortinbras, who is eager for power, has gathered a group of lawless followers in Norway. They are preparing to forcefully take back the lands that Fortinbras' father lost. This is the reason we are preparing for war and why we are on high alert.

BARNARDO. I think that's exactly what's happening. It makes sense that this strange figure is walking through our watch, looking like the king who started these wars.

HORATIO. It's something that troubles the mind. In ancient Rome, right before Julius Caesar died, the graves were empty and the ghosts of the dead were wandering the streets. There were strange occurrences in the sky, like shooting stars and red rain. It seemed like disasters were happening. Even the moon, which controls the seas, was sick and almost disappeared. These are signs that something bad is about to happen. Heaven and earth have shown us these signs.

[The ghost returns]

But wait, look! There it is again! I'll confront it, even if it harms me. Stay, illusion! If you can make any sound or speak, talk to me. If there's anything good that you can do to give yourself peace and help me, speak to me. If you know what will happen to our country and can prevent it, speak! Or if you have hidden treasure buried in the ground, as they say spirits often do, talk about it. Stay and speak!

[The rooster crows]

Stop it, Marcellus!

MARCELLUS. Should I attack it with my weapon?

HORATIO. Go ahead, if it doesn't disappear.

BARNARDO. It's here!

HORATIO. It's here!

[The ghost disappears]

MARCELLUS. It's gone! We shouldn't have tried to attack it. It's like air, invulnerable, and our attempts to harm it were just mockery.

BARNARDO. It was about to speak when the rooster crowed.

HORATIO. And then it disappeared, as if it was guilty and scared of being called. I've heard that the rooster, which announces the morning, wakes up the sun god with its loud and high-pitched call. When the rooster crows, whether it's at sea, on land, in the sky, or underground, spirits have to go back to where they belong. This sighting confirms that.

MARCELLUS. It disappeared when the rooster crowed. Some say that when it's time to celebrate the birth of our savior, the morning bird sings all night long. During that time, spirits are not allowed to roam around. The nights are safe, planets don't cause harm, fairies and witches lose their powers. It's a holy and peaceful time.

HORATIO. I've heard that too, and I partly believe it. But look, the morning is coming. Let's end our watch and, in my opinion, let's tell young Hamlet about what we've seen tonight. I am certain that this silent spirit will speak to him. Do you agree that we should inform him? It's necessary for our love and duty.

MARCELLUS. Let's go, I pray, and I know where we can find him easily.

[They exit.]

SCENE II. Elsinore. A grand room in the Castle.

Claudius, the King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants enter.

KING. Although the memory of our dear brother Hamlet's death is still fresh, and it is fitting for us to grieve and for our entire kingdom to share in our sorrow, we have managed to control our emotions enough to think about him wisely, while also remembering ourselves. That is why we have married our former sister, who is now our queen and the ruler of this powerful state. We have done so with mixed feelings of joy and sadness, celebrating her marriage while mourning our brother's death. We have not made this decision without considering your wisdom, which has been freely given in support of this marriage. We thank you all for that. Now, let me tell you about young Fortinbras. He mistakenly believes that our kingdom is weak and in chaos after the death of our brother, and he has been bothering us with messages demanding that we surrender the lands his father lost. That's enough about him. Now, let's talk about ourselves and the purpose of this meeting: we have written a letter to the uncle of young Fortinbras, the King of Norway, who is old and weak and can barely hear. We have asked him to stop his nephew's aggressive intentions, as his troops, resources, and preparations have all been taken from his own subjects. We are sending you, Cornelius and Voltemand, as messengers to deliver this message, but you have no personal authority to negotiate with the King beyond what is written in the letter. Farewell, and may your haste demonstrate your loyalty.

CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND. We will fulfill our duty in all aspects.

KING. We have no doubt about it. Farewell.

[Cornelius and Voltemand exit.]

And now, Laertes, what news do you have? You mentioned some request. What is it, Laertes? Speak up, don't hold back. What do you want that I won't offer without you asking? Your father's position is as important to Denmark as the head is to the heart or the hand is to the mouth. What is your request, Laertes?

LAERTES. My lord, I ask for your permission and approval to return to France. Although I willingly came to Denmark to show my loyalty during your coronation, now that I have fulfilled my duty, my thoughts and desires once again turn towards France. I humbly ask for your gracious permission and forgiveness.

KING. Have you received your father's permission? What does Polonius say?

POLONIUS. He has, my lord, obtained my reluctant consent through persistent requests. Finally, I agreed to let him go. I beg you to grant him permission to leave.

KING. Take your time, Laertes. Use it wisely and enjoy it to the fullest. But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my sonâ€”

HAMLET. [Aside.] He's more than just a relative, but less than a true family member.

KING. Why do you still seem so gloomy, Hamlet?

HAMLET. Not at all, my lord. I am just too exposed to the sun.

QUEEN. My dear Hamlet, stop looking so sad and let your eyes show friendship towards Denmark. Don't always keep your eyes lowered, searching for your noble father in the dust. You know that death is a part of life, and everyone must pass through it to reach eternity.

HAMLET. Yes, madam, it is a common truth.

QUEEN. If that's the case, why does it affect you so deeply?

HAMLET. It's not just an appearance, madam! It truly affects me. It's not just my black cloak, mother, or the customary mourning clothes, or forced sighs, or tears in my eyes, or the sad expression on my face. All these things can be seen and imitated, but I have something deeper within me that cannot be shown. These external signs of grief are just superficial decorations.

KING: It's sweet and admirable of you, Hamlet, to honor your father with these mourning duties. But you must understand that your father also lost his own father, and it is our duty as his survivors to mourn for a certain period of time. However, to continue grieving stubbornly is impious and unmanly. It shows a lack of willpower, an unfortified heart, and an unschooled mind. Death is inevitable and common, so why should we oppose it so bitterly? It is a fault to heaven, a fault against the dead, and a fault against nature. It is absurd to reason that death of fathers is a common theme and has always been. We urge you to let go of this overwhelming sorrow and think of us as your father. You are the one closest to our throne, and I love you just as a father loves his son. Your decision to go back to school in Wittenberg is against our wishes. We beg you to stay here where we can see you, as our most important courtier, cousin, and son.

QUEEN: Hamlet, please don't ignore your mother's prayers. I beg you to stay with us and not go to Wittenberg.

HAMLET: I will do my best to obey you, mother.

KING: That's a loving and fair response. Be as we are in Denmark. Come, my queen. Hamlet's agreement brings joy to my heart. In celebration, let the cannons tell Denmark's health to the skies, and let the King's toast resound in heaven, echoing like thunder. Let's go.

[Everyone exits except for Hamlet.]

HAMLET: Oh, I wish my flesh would melt away and become a dew! Or that God hadn't forbidden suicide. Oh God! How tired, boring, and useless everything in this world seems to me! It's an overgrown and neglected garden, filled with disgusting and vulgar things. How did it come to this? My father has only been dead for two monthsâ€”no, not even that long. He was an excellent king, like Hyperion compared to a satyr. He loved my mother so much that he wouldn't let the winds of heaven harm her. Heaven and earth! Do I have to remember this? She clung to him as if her appetite for him grew stronger every day. And yet, within a monthâ€”let me not think about itâ€”women, oh women, how frail you are! In just a short month, she married my uncle, my father's brother. But he's nothing like my father, just as I'm nothing like Hercules. Within a month? Before her tears could dry, she married again. Oh, how quickly she rushed into an incestuous relationship! This can't end well. But I must keep my heartbreak to myself.

[Hortatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo enter.]

HORATIO: Greetings, my lord!

HAMLET: I'm glad to see you well, Horatio, if I haven't forgotten myself.

HORATIO: It's me, my lord, your loyal servant.

HAMLET: Sir, my good friend. I'll call you by that name too. And what brings you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?

MARCELLUS: My lord.

HAMLET: I'm very glad to see you. Good evening, sir. But tell me, what made you leave Wittenberg?

HORATIO: I had a desire to see your father's funeral, my lord.

HAMLET: Please don't make fun of me, my friend. I think I saw my mother getting married.

HORATIO: Indeed, my lord, it happened soon after.

HAMLET: How ironic, Horatio! The food from the funeral was used for the wedding feast. I wish I had met my worst enemy in heaven before seeing that day, Horatio. My father... I can still see my father.

HORATIO: Where, my lord?

HAMLET: In my mind's eye, Horatio.

HORATIO: I saw him once; he was a great king.

HAMLET: He was just a man, take him as a whole, I will never see anyone like him again.

HORATIO: My lord, I think I saw him last night.

HAMLET: Saw? Who?

HORATIO: My lord, your father, the king.

HAMLET: My father, the king!

HORATIO: Listen closely, until I can confirm this with the testimony of these gentlemen. They encountered a figure that looked just like your father, fully armed, walking slowly and majestically past them. He walked by them three times, just a few steps away, while they were frozen with fear and unable to speak. They told me this in secret, and I witnessed it myself on the third night. Everything they described was true. I knew your father; these hands are just like his.

HAMLET: But where did this happen?

MARCELLUS: My lord, on the platform where we were keeping watch.

HAMLET: Did you not speak to it?

HORATIO: My lord, I did, but it didn't respond. Although, at one point, it seemed to lift its head as if it wanted to speak. But then the rooster crowed and it quickly disappeared.

HAMLET: It's very strange.

HORATIO: I swear, my honored lord, it's true. We felt it was our duty to tell you.

HAMLET: Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Are you keeping watch tonight?

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO: Yes, my lord.

HAMLET: Armed, you say?

Both: Yes, my lord.

HAMLET: From head to toe?

BOTH: Yes, my lord.

HAMLET: So you didn't see his face?

HORATIO: Oh yes, my lord, he had his helmet on.

HAMLET: Did he look angry?

HORATIO: His expression showed more sadness than anger.

HAMLET: Pale or red?

HORATIO: Very pale.

HAMLET: And he stared at you?

HORATIO: Constantly.

HAMLET: I wish I had been there.

HORATIO: It would have amazed you.

HAMLET: Very likely, very likely. Did it stay for long?

HORATIO: It stayed for as long as it takes to count to a hundred at a moderate pace.

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO: Longer, longer.

HORATIO: Not when I saw it.

HAMLET: His beard was gray, right?

HORATIO: Yes, it was, just like I've seen it before, a mix of black and white.

HAMLET: I will keep watch tonight. Maybe it will appear again.

HORATIO: I'm sure it will.

HAMLET: If it takes on my noble father's appearance, I will speak to it, even if it's as if hell itself is telling me to be quiet. I beg you all, if you have kept this sighting a secret until now, please continue to keep silent about it. And whatever else happens tonight, understand it but don't speak of it. I will repay your loyalty. So, farewell. I will visit you on the platform between eleven and twelve.

ALL: We are loyal to you, my lord.

HAMLET: Your loyalty is reciprocated. Farewell.

[Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo exit]

My father's ghost in armor! Something is not right; I suspect foul play. I wish the night would come! Until then, I will wait patiently, knowing that evil deeds will eventually come to light.
