Once upon a time, in a place called Bloemfontein, South Africa, there was a hotel called the Orange Hotel. On January 24, 1932, four men were in a room on the third floor of the hotel. They were very scared and shivering. One of the men was the owner of the hotel, another was a police officer, the third was a coroner, and the fourth was a doctor.

In the room, there was a dead body on the floor, but that wasn't what scared them. They were scared because there were strange writings on the ceiling and a weird fly in a bottle of ammonia on the table. The doctor also had a journal in his hand that belonged to the dead man. The journal revealed that the name the dead man had used in the hotel register was fake. It also contained terrible things that made the four men very afraid.

The journal was written in a fine handwriting and described the activities of the dead man. The doctor recognized the dead man's name because he was a famous doctor too. As the doctor read the journal out loud, the other three men felt more and more scared and uncomfortable.

The journal talked about the dead man's plan to kill another man named Dr. Henry Moore. The dead man had a strong reason for wanting to kill Dr. Moore, which the public already knew about. The dead man had studied medicine and specialized in African fevers. He had become famous for his research and was even offered a high position in the health service. But instead of accepting the offer, he decided to seek revenge on Dr. Moore.

The dead man's journal explained that he had a plan to kill Dr. Moore and he was determined to carry it out. He talked about his background, growing up in New Jersey and studying medicine. He also mentioned his time spent in Africa doing research on fevers. He had discovered a new theory and became well-known for his work.

The dead man's journal was a disturbing read, and the four men in the room couldn't help but feel scared and uneasy as they listened to the doctor read it out loud.
