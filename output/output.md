Scene I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two guards.

BARNARDO.
Who's there?

FRANCISCO.
No, tell me. Stand and show yourself.

BARNARDO.
Long live the King!

FRANCISCO.
Barnardo?

BARNARDO.
Yes.

FRANCISCO.
You're right on time.

BARNARDO.
It's twelve o'clock now. Go to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO.
Thanks for taking over. It's freezing out here,
And I feel sick.

BARNARDO.
Did you have a quiet shift?

FRANCISCO.
Not a sound, not even a mouse.

BARNARDO.
Alright, good night.
If you see Horatio and Marcellus,
The guys who take over from me, tell them to hurry up.

Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

FRANCISCO.
I think I hear them. Stop! Who's there?

HORATIO.
We're friends of this place.

MARCELLUS.
And loyal to the King.

FRANCISCO.
Good night to you.

MARCELLUS.
Goodbye, honest soldier. Who relieved you?

FRANCISCO.
Barnardo took over. Good night to you.

[Exit]

MARCELLUS.
Hey, Barnardo!

BARNARDO.
Tell me, is Horatio there?

HORATIO.
Sort of.

BARNARDO.
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, Marcellus.

MARCELLUS.
Has that thing appeared again tonight?

BARNARDO.
I haven't seen anything.

MARCELLUS.
Horatio thinks it's just our imagination,
And he doesn't believe in this ghost we've seen twice.
So I asked him to join us tonight
To watch and see if it appears again,
So he can see it and talk to it.

HORATIO.
Nah, it won't show up.

BARNARDO.
Sit down for a moment,
And let us tell you again,
Even though you don't believe us,
What we've seen these past two nights.

HORATIO.
Alright, let's sit down.
Barnardo, go ahead and tell us.

BARNARDO.
Last night,
When that same star in the west,
Lit up that part of the sky
Where it's shining now, Marcellus and I,
The bell struck one--

MARCELLUS.
Quiet, stop talking. Look, it's coming again.

Enter Ghost.

BARNARDO.
In the same form, like the dead King.

MARCELLUS.
You're a scholar, talk to it, Horatio.

BARNARDO.
Doesn't it look like the King? Pay attention, Horatio.

HORATIO.
Most likely. It makes me afraid and curious.

BARNARDO.
It wants to be spoken to.

MARCELLUS.
Ask it a question, Horatio.

HORATIO.
Who are you, appearing at this time of night,
With the appearance of the late King of Denmark,
Who used to lead our armies? By heaven, I demand you to speak.

MARCELLUS.
It's angry.

BARNARDO.
Look, it's walking away.

HORATIO.
Wait! Speak, speak! I command you to speak!

[Exit Ghost]

MARCELLUS.
It's gone, and it won't answer.

BARNARDO.
What's wrong, Horatio? You're trembling and pale.
Isn't this more than just imagination?
What do you think?

HORATIO.
I swear to God, I wouldn't believe it
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

MARCELLUS.
Doesn't it look like the King?

HORATIO.
It's as real as you are to yourself.
It's wearing the same armor he wore
When he fought against Norway.
I remember him frowning like that
When he argued with the Polish soldiers on the ice.
It's strange.

MARCELLUS.
It has appeared twice before, at this same hour,
Walking by our watch.

HORATIO.
I don't know what it's planning,
But from what I can gather,
Something big and dangerous is about to happen to our country.

MARCELLUS.
Come on, sit down and tell me,
If you know, why this strict watch
Is happening every night,
And why so many cannons are being prepared for war,
And why there are so many shipbuilders working,
Even on Sundays.
What's going on that everyone is in such a hurry,
Working day and night?
Who can tell me?

HORATIO.
Let me explain it to you;
At least, this is what people are saying. Our previous King,
Whose image we just saw,
Was killed in a battle with Fortinbras of Norway,
Because Fortinbras was driven by a strong desire to prove himself,
He dared to fight; and in that battle, our brave Hamlet,
Who is highly esteemed in our part of the world,
Killed Fortinbras. By a sealed agreement,
That was recognized by law and heraldry,
Fortinbras forfeited all the lands he possessed
To the conqueror, our King;
A portion of those lands was pledged
By our King, and would have been returned
To Fortinbras if he had won the battle;
But according to the same agreement,
The lands went to Hamlet. Now, young Fortinbras,
Who is inexperienced but ambitious,
Has gathered a group of lawless men
In Norway, to carry out a plan
That requires a lot of courage; which is, as it seems,
To forcefully take back those lands
That his father lost. And I believe
This is the main reason for our preparations,
The reason we are on watch, and the main cause
Of our haste and search throughout the land.

BARNARDO.
I think it's no other than that:
It makes sense that this ghostly figure
Is coming towards us, dressed like the King
Who was the cause of these wars, and is still a mystery.

HORATIO.
It's like a vision that troubles the mind.
In ancient Rome, when it was at its height and most powerful,
Shortly before the mighty Julius Caesar fell,
The graves were empty and the dead, wrapped in sheets,
Could be heard whispering and chattering in the streets;
There were shooting stars and bloody rain,
Disasters in the sun; and the moon,
Which controls the tides ruled by Neptune,
Was sick and almost darkened, as if it were doomsday.
And even similar events that foretell terrible things,
Like signs that come before a prophecy comes true,
Have been shown to our country and people
By both heaven and earth.

[The Ghost enters again.]

But wait, look! There it is again!
I'll confront it, even if it kills me. Wait, illusion!
If you can make any sound, or speak,
Talk to me.
If there's anything good that can be done,
That can bring you ease and grace to me,
Speak to me.
If you know what will happen to your country,
And if you can prevent it by telling us,
Oh, speak!
Or if you have hidden treasures on earth,
For which, they say, spirits often walk in death,
Tell me about it. Wait, and speak!

[The rooster crows.]

Stop it, Marcellus!

MARCELLUS.
Should I attack it with my weapon?

HORATIO.
Go ahead, if it doesn't disappear.

BARNARDO.
It's still here!

HORATIO.
It's still here!

[The Ghost exits.]

MARCELLUS.
It's gone!
We're wrong to try to harm something so majestic,
Because it's like air, invulnerable,
And our attempts to harm it are just mockery.

BARNARDO.
It was about to speak, when the rooster crowed.

HORATIO.
And then it vanished, like a guilty thing
Summoned to appear before a judge. I've heard
That the rooster, who announces the morning,
Wakes up the sun god with its loud and shrill call;
And when that happens,
Whether it's in the sea or fire, on land or in the air,
The wandering and restless spirit
Returns to its realm. And this present object
Proves that this is true.

MARCELLUS.
It disappeared when the rooster crowed.
Some people say that every time
The season when our Savior's birth is celebrated comes,
The bird of dawn sings all night long;
And then, they say, no spirit dares to roam around,
The nights are peaceful, no planets cause harm,
No fairy takes anyone, and no witch has the power to cast a spell;
That's how holy and blessed that time is.

HORATIO.
I've heard the same, and I partly believe it.
But look, the morning is coming, dressed in a red cloak,
Walking over the dew on that high hill in the east.
Let's end our watch, and, in my opinion,
Let's tell young Hamlet what we've seen tonight;
Because I'm sure this silent spirit will speak to him.
Do you agree that we should tell him,
As an act of love and duty?

MARCELLUS.
Let's do it, I pray, and I know this morning
Where we can conveniently find him.

[They exit.]

SCENE II. Elsinore. A grand room in the Castle.

Claudius, the King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords and Attendants enter.

KING.
Even though the memory of our dear brother Hamlet's death is still fresh, and it is fitting for us to mourn and for our whole kingdom to be in sorrow,
We have managed to control our grief and think of him with wise sorrow,
along with remembering ourselves.
Therefore, our former sister, now our queen,
who is the rightful wife of this warlike state,
we have married her with mixed emotions,
with one eye filled with joy and one with tears,
with celebration and mourning,
balancing happiness and sorrow equally.
We have not disregarded your wisdom in this matter,
which you have freely supported.
Thank you all.
Now, you should know about young Fortinbras,
who, thinking our state is weak after the recent death of our dear brother,
has been bothering us with messages,
demanding the surrender of the lands his father lost,
according to the law.
That's enough about him.
Now, for ourselves and for this meeting:
We have written to the uncle of young Fortinbras, the King of Norway,
who is old and weak, and barely hears anything about his nephew's plans,
to stop him from taking any further action.
Since all the preparations have been made
from his territory, we are sending you, Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
to deliver this message to old Norway.
You have no personal power beyond what is allowed by these instructions.
Farewell, and let your haste show your duty.

CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.
We will do our duty in all things.

KING.
We have no doubt about it. Farewell.

[Cornelius and Voltemand exit.]

And now, Laertes, what is your news?
You mentioned some request. What is it, Laertes?
You cannot speak freely to the king and lose your voice.
What do you want, Laertes,
that I would not offer you, but you have to ask for?
Denmark is as important to your father as his own body.
What do you desire, Laertes?

LAERTES.
My lord, I humbly ask for your permission and favor
to return to France.
Although I willingly came to Denmark
to show my duty at your coronation,
now that my duty is done,
my thoughts and wishes turn back to France,
and I bow to your gracious permission and pardon.

KING.
Do you have your father's permission? What does Polonius say?

POLONIUS.
He does, my lord. I had to give it reluctantly
after his persistent request. I finally agreed.
I beg you to grant him permission to go.

KING.
Take your time, Laertes. It's up to you,
and use your best qualities as you wish!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—

HAMLET.
[Aside.] More than just a relative, but not truly family.

KING.
Why do you still seem troubled, Hamlet?

HAMLET.
Not so, my lord. I am too exposed to the sun.

QUEEN.
Good Hamlet, shake off your dark mood,
and let your eyes look kindly upon Denmark.
Don't keep searching for your noble father in the dust forever.
You know that death is common, and everyone must die,
passing through nature to eternity.

HAMLET.
Yes, madam, it is common.

QUEEN.
If that's the case,
why does it seem so personal to you?

HAMLET.
Seems, madam! No, it is personal. I don't pretend.
It's not just my black cloak, good mother,
or the formal black attire,
or the forced sighs and tears,
or the river of tears in my eyes,
or the sad expression on my face.
All these things may seem like signs of grief,
but they are just outward actions.
I have something within me that surpasses appearances.
These are just the decorations and symbols of sorrow.

KING:
It's good and commendable of you, Hamlet,
To mourn for your father;
But you should know, your father lost his father,
That father lost his, and the one who survived
Is obligated to mourn for a certain time.
But to continue in stubborn sorrow
Is impious and unmanly.
It shows a will that is incorrect to heaven,
A weak heart, an impatient mind,
An ignorant and unschooled understanding.
We all know that death is common,
As common as anything that can be sensed.
So why should we oppose it and take it to heart?
Fie! It's a fault against heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault against nature,
And an absurd way of thinking.
Death of fathers is a common theme,
And it has always been this way.
We ask you to let go of this overwhelming grief,
And think of us as a father figure.
The world should take note
That you are next in line for the throne,
And I love you just as much as a father loves his son.
Your decision to go back to school in Wittenberg
Goes against what we desire.
We urge you to stay here,
In the comfort and happiness of our presence,
As our closest advisor, cousin, and son.

QUEEN:
Don't disappoint your mother, Hamlet.
I beg you to stay with us and not go to Wittenberg.

HAMLET:
I will obey you, madam, to the best of my ability.

KING:
That's a loving and fair response.
Be yourself here in Denmark. Madam, let's go.
Hamlet's agreement brings joy to my heart.
As a celebration, let the cannons in Denmark
Announce to the heavens,
And let the heavens respond with thunder.
Let's go.

[Everyone exits except Hamlet.]

HAMLET:
Oh, I wish my body could melt away,
Disappear like dew!
Or that God hadn't forbidden
Suicide. Oh God! Oh God!
Everything in this world
Seems tiresome, dull, and meaningless to me.
Fie on it! It's like an overgrown, neglected garden,
Full of disgusting things. How did it come to this?
My father died only two months ago,
No, not even two months:
He was such a great king,
Like a god compared to a beast.
He loved my mother so much
That he wouldn't let the winds of heaven
Harm her face. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? She clung to him
As if her desire for him grew
Every time she saw him. And yet, within a month—
I can't think about it—Women, your name is frailty!
In just a month, before her shoes were even worn out
From following my father's body, crying like Niobe—
She, yes, she—
Oh God! Even an irrational animal
Would have mourned longer. She married
My uncle, my father's brother. But he is nothing like my father.
Within a month?
Before the tears had dried from her eyes,
She married him. It was so quick,
It's not right, and it won't end well.
But it breaks my heart, because I must remain silent.

Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.

HORATIO:
Greetings, my lord!

HAMLET:
I'm glad to see you well.
Horatio, I hope I haven't forgotten myself.

HORATIO:
It's me, my lord,
Your humble servant, as always.

HAMLET:
Sir, my good friend;
I'll call you by that name.
And what brings you here from Wittenberg, Horatio?—
Marcellus?

MARCELLUS:
Yes, my lord.

HAMLET:
I'm very glad to see you. Good evening, sir.
But really, what brings you here from Wittenberg?

HORATIO:
I just needed a break, my lord.

HAMLET:
I wouldn't want to hear your enemies say that about you.
And I won't let you make me doubt you,
To make me believe your own negative reports.
I know you're not someone who skips out on responsibilities.
But what is your business in Elsinore?
We'll make sure you have a good time before you leave.

HORATIO.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

HAMLET.
Please don't make fun of me, my friend. I think you came to see my mother's wedding.

HORATIO.
Indeed, my lord, it happened soon after.

HAMLET.
How strange! The food that was meant for the funeral was used for the wedding feast. I wish I had gone to heaven before seeing that day. My father... I can still see my father.

HORATIO.
Where, my lord?

HAMLET.
In my mind, Horatio.

HORATIO.
I saw him once; he was a great king.

HAMLET.
He was just a man, but there will never be anyone like him again.

HORATIO.
My lord, I think I saw him last night.

HAMLET.
Saw who?

HORATIO.
My lord, your father, the King.

HAMLET.
My father, the King!

HORATIO.
Listen carefully and I will tell you what happened. These two gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, were on watch for two nights in the middle of the night. They saw a figure that looked exactly like your father, fully armed. He walked slowly and majestically right by them, three times. They were terrified and couldn't speak. They told me about it in secret, and I saw it myself on the third night. Everything they had described was true. I knew it was your father; the resemblance was uncanny.

HAMLET.
But where did this happen?

MARCELLUS.
My lord, on the platform where we were keeping watch.

HAMLET.
Did you talk to it?

HORATIO.
Yes, my lord, I did. But it didn't respond. Although, at one point, it seemed like it was about to speak. But then, the rooster crowed and it disappeared.

HAMLET.
That's very strange.

HORATIO.
I swear, my honored lord, it's true. We thought it was our duty to tell you about it.

HAMLET.
Indeed, it troubles me. Will you be on watch tonight?

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.
Yes, my lord.

HAMLET.
And was it armed?

Both.
Yes, my lord.

HAMLET.
From head to toe?

BOTH.
Yes, my lord.

HAMLET.
Did you see its face?

HORATIO.
Yes, my lord, it had its helmet on.

HAMLET.
Did it look angry?

HORATIO.
Its face showed more sorrow than anger.

HAMLET.
Was it pale or red?

HORATIO.
No, very pale.

HAMLET.
And did it keep staring at you?

HORATIO.
Yes, constantly.

HAMLET.
I wish I had been there.

HORATIO.
It would have amazed you.

HAMLET.
Very likely. Did it stay for a long time?

HORATIO.
About as long as it takes to count to a hundred.

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.
Longer, longer.

HORATIO.
Not when I saw it.

HAMLET.
Was its beard gray?

HORATIO.
Yes, it was just like I had seen it in his life, a dark gray.

HAMLET.
I will keep watch tonight. Maybe it will appear again.

HORATIO.
I'm sure it will.

HAMLET.
If it takes the form of my noble father, I will speak to it, even if it seems like it's from hell. I beg you all, if you have kept this sighting a secret until now, continue to do so. And whatever else happens tonight, understand it but don't speak of it. I will repay your loyalty. Farewell to all of you. I will visit you on the platform between eleven and twelve.

ALL.
We are devoted to you, my lord.

HAMLET.
And I am devoted to you. Goodbye.

[Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo exit.]
